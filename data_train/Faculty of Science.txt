4.1 Programs in the Faculty of Science
1. The Faculty of Science offers a variety of programs which lead to a General Degree of Bachelor of Science or an Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science. These programs consist of a minimum of 120 credit hours in courses which include the following:

   1. the Core Requirements, as described under Core Requirements and Academic Advising,
   2. a Program of Study, as described under Programs of Study for the General Degree of Bachelor of Science and Programs of Study for the Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science, as part of which one or more Major programs shall be completed, and
   3. a number of additional courses, as described under Electives.

      2. In conjunction with the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science offers the Joint Degrees of Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts, which simultaneously leads to both a General Degree of Bachelor of Science and a General Degree of Bachelor of Arts.

      3. The Faculty of Science also offers a number of Minor programs, as described under Minor Programs in the Faculty of Science. These are available to students completing a General Degree of Bachelor of Science or an Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science, but may also be undertaken by students in other degree programs should the regulations of those programs permit it.

      4. A Major or a Minor consists, in part, of an approved concentration of courses in a single subject area, known respectively as the Major subject or Minor subject. These subject areas may include: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Economics, Geography, Human Biosciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Ocean Sciences, Physics, or Psychology.

      5. For the purposes of a General Degree of Bachelor of Science or an Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science, a student may complete at most one Major program from each department which offers more than one, and may not complete a Minor program from the department of any of the student’s Major programs.

      6. When a Major program may be completed both as part of the Degree of Bachelor of Science and the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, students are free to choose the degree program they wish to follow and may change from one to the other; however, they may not obtain both degrees in the same Major program at this University.

11.2.3.2 Major in Biology (Co-operative) Program (BCOP)
www.mun.ca/coop
This program is available to full-time Biology majors only.
The Biology (Co-operative) Program (BCOP) provides an opportunity for students to learn valuable practical skills while working in fields related to Biology. Students complete three Work Terms, which consist of full-time, normally paid employment in the field of Biology of at least 12 weeks in duration. The timing of the Work Terms is such that employers stand to gain from the acquired skills of biology majors in training. The objectives of the Work Term component of the BCOP are embodied in the Work Term descriptions found at the end of the Faculty of Science section under Course Descriptions, Biology, Work Term Descriptions.
                                                                        1. Admission Requirements

                                                                           1. Admission is limited, competitive, and selective.

                                                                           2. The primary criteria used in reaching decisions on applications for admission are motivation and overall academic achievement. Students may be required to participate in an interview as part of the selection process.

                                                                           3. A student must first be admitted to the Biology Major.

                                                                           4. Application deadline: October 15 for the following Spring semester work term (normally the third semester in year two).

                                                                           5. To be eligible for admission, a student must have completed the second year Biology Core, with an overall average of at least 65%, and an overall average of at least 65% in all Biology courses before the start of the first work term. A student must have an overall average of 65% in all other required courses, and must be registered as a full- time student in the semester in which application is made.

                                                                              2. Program of Study

                                                                                 1. In addition to the requirements below, a student must fulfill all requirements for a Major in Biology or Honours in Biology.

                                                                                 2. Students’ status in the program is assessed at the end of each semester. To remain in BCOP, a student must receive a passing grade in all required courses, and must maintain an overall average of at least 65% in all Biology courses and an overall average of at least 65% in all courses, including electives. A student who fails a required course, fails to maintain an overall average of 65% in Biology courses, or fails to maintain an overall average of 65%, will be required to withdraw from BCOP. The student in question may apply for readmission in a subsequent year after passing the specified required course(s) previously failed, or re-establishing the required average.

                                                                                 3. A student is required to successfully complete three work terms, one of which will normally be either in the Fall or Winter semester.

                                                                                    3. Work Term Placement

                                                                                       1. General management of the BCOP is the responsibility of the designated Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education (ASM-CE). ASM-CE’s are responsible for facilitating the engagement of potential employers in the program, organizing competitions for Work Term employment, arranging job interviews and facilities, managing the co-op data base, and developing employment opportunities and monitoring and evaluating students during the work term.

                                                                                       2. Students are ultimately responsible for securing their work term placements. ASMs-CE provide support for the job search and inform students of potential opportunities.

                                                                                       3. A student who is admitted to the co-op program gives permission to the University to provide a copy of the applicant’s resume, university transcript and work term evaluations to potential employers.

                                                                                       4. A student who has been accepted to BCOP may independently obtain a work term placement in consultation with the ASM-CE. Such employment positions must satisfy the criteria for work terms, be confirmed in writing by the employer and be approved by the ASM-CE before the first day of the work term according to the Co-operative Education website.

                                                                                          4. Registration and Evaluation of Performance

                                                                                             1. In Work Terms I, II, and III, a student must register for Biology 199W, 299W, and 399W respectively.

                                                                                             2. The Work Term evaluations shall consist of two components:

                                                                                                1. On-the-job Student Performance:

Job performance shall be assessed by Co-operative Education in consultation with the department using information gathered during the Work Term and input from the employer towards the end of the Work Term. Formal written documentation from the employer shall be sought. Evaluation of the job performance will result in one of the following classifications: OUTSTANDING, ABOVE EXPECTATIONS, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL PASS, FAIL.

                                                                                                2. Assignment(s):

                                                                                                   * A student is required to submit one or more assignment(s) to Co-operative Education as outlined in the course syllabus.

                                                                                                   * Assignment(s) are evaluated by a faculty member and an ASM-CE.

                                                                                                      3. Evaluation of the work term assignment(s) will result in one of the following classifications: OUTSTANDING, ABOVE EXPECTATIONS, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL PASS, FAIL.

The evaluation of the job performance and the assignment(s) are recorded separately on the transcript. Overall evaluation of the work term will result in one of the following final grades being awarded:

                                                                                                         * Pass with Distinction: Indicates OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE in both the assignment(s) and the job performance.

                                                                                                         * Pass: Indicates that PERFORMANCE MEETS EXPECTATIONS in both the assignment(s) and the job performance.

                                                                                                         * Fail: Indicates FAILING PERFORMANCE in the assignment(s) or the job performance, or both. To remain in BCOP, a student must obtain a final grade of Pass or higher.

                                                                                                            3. If a student fails to achieve the Work Term standards specified above, the student will be required to withdraw from BCOP. Such a student may reapply to the program, at which time the student will be required to repeat the Work Term with satisfactory performance. Only one Work Term may be repeated in the entire program.

                                                                                                            4. A student who withdraws from a Work Term without acceptable cause subsequent to a job placement will be required to withdraw permanently from BCOP.

                                                                                                            5. A student who drops a Work Term without prior approval from both Co-operative Education and the Biology Co-op Liaison, or who fails to honour an agreement to work with an employer, or who conducts in such a manner as to cause the discharge from the job, will be awarded an overall grade of FAIL for the Work Term in question and will be required to withdraw permanently from BCOP.

                                                                                                            6. Permission to drop a Work Term does not constitute a waiver of degree requirements, and a student who has obtained such permission must successfully complete an approved Work Term in lieu of the one dropped.

A thesis based on a selected research topic carried out under the supervision of a member of the Department is to be submitted in the final year.

                                                                                                                                                                                       2. Chemistry 490A/B will normally require the equivalent of nine hours per week for two semesters. Registration in Chemistry 490A/B is restricted to those students who have honours standing. The Honours dissertation will be assessed by a committee comprising the supervisor and one other faculty member.

                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Students completing first year requirements for any of Chemistry, Mathematics or Physics via the three course options (i.e. Chemistry 1010, 1050, 1051, Mathematics 1090, 1000, 1001 or 109A/B, 1000, 1001, Physics 1020, 1021, 1051) instead of the two course options (Chemistry 1050, 1051, Chemistry 1200, 1001, Mathematics 1000, 1001, Physics 1050, 1051) will require the corresponding number of extra credits to obtain an Honours degree.

                                                                                                                                                                                       4. Arrangements for subsequent years will depend on the other science subjects being studied and should be made in consultation with a Faculty Advisor.

                                                                                                                                                                                       5.

General management of the CICS is the responsibility of Academic Staff Member(s) in Co- operative Education (ASM-CE). ASMs-CE are responsible for developing employment opportunities, organizing competitions for co-operative internship employment, co-operative education data management, monitoring students during co-operative internships, and evaluating co-operative internships.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2. Subject to the availability of appropriate co-operative internship employment, a student may complete a co-operative internship of 8, 12 or 16 consecutive months with a single employer. Co-operative internships are full-time, paid, and involve work that is relevant to the discipline of computer science.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        3. The co-operative internship start and end dates are listed at www.mun.ca/coop.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        4. Students are ultimately responsible for securing their co-operative internship. ASMs-CE provide support for the job search and inform students of potential opportunities.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        5. Students who are admitted to the co-operative internship program give permission to ASMs-CE to supply prospective employers with copies of their resume and transcript.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        6. A student who has been admitted to the CICS may independently obtain a co-operative internship in consultation with an ASM-CE. Such employment positions must satisfy the criteria for co-operative internships, be confirmed in writing by the employer and approved by an ASM-CE before the first day of the work term.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        7. Students must register for the course Computer Science 3700 every semester during their co-operative internship. Computer Science 3700 is considered a full-time course load.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        8. Students are not permitted to drop their co-operative internship without prior approval from an ASM-CE and the Head of the Department of Computer Science. Students who drop a co-operative internship without permission, who fail to honour an agreement to work with an employer, or who conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause their discharge from the co-operative internship, will normally be awarded a fail grade for the a co-operative internship period and may not be permitted to reapply to the CICS.

Note:
Students should also refer to the University Regulations (Undergraduate), General Academic Regulations (Undergraduate).

Students are advised that this is the minimum requirement for the General B.Sc. in Earth Sciences. Many provinces, including Newfoundland and Labrador, have legislation requiring registration of professional geoscientists. A basic requirement for registration is, in most cases, the course equivalent of an Honours B.Sc. degree. Students intending to make a career in Earth Sciences should consider taking the Honours Degree program of courses, regardless of whether honours standing is maintained.

Students wishing to pursue study within the programs offered by Earth Sciences are strongly advised to keep in close contact with the Department to discuss course programs before registration in order to maintain proper sequencing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2. Students wishing to take some Earth Sciences courses without intending to major in Earth Sciences should consult with the Head of Department (or delegate) to determine the courses most suitable to their needs and capabilities. Earth Sciences 2914, 2915, 2916, 2917, 2918, and 2150 are especially suitable for such students and have no Earth Sciences prerequisites.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3. Most courses comprise six hours of instruction per week, usually three hours of lectures or seminars and a three-hour laboratory period; however, at an advanced level other methods of instruction may be adopted.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                4. The field courses 2905, 3705, 3905 and 4905 require payment of a participation fee to cover costs for logistics and equipment. Registration for these courses will be by application only and may be competitive.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                5. The prerequisites for courses 4302, 4902 and 4903 refer to core courses in the Faculty of Science. For the purposes of these prerequisite statements, core courses are defined as those courses that are specified by each department as mandatory to fulfil the course requirements for their General or Honours programs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                6. Certain 4000 level courses may not be offered every year.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                7. At most 6 credit hours in courses at the 1000-level can be used towards the course requirements in Earth Sciences for the Major, Minor, Joint Major, Honours or Joint Honours.

How do food, drugs and the environment impact your health? That is the central question of the Human Biosciences program. Introductory courses provide the necessary background in an interdisciplinary manner with each course blending concepts from biochemistry, nutrition, pharmacology, and toxicology. Students may tailor their program to their own interests through diverse electives leading to one of our pre-defined sub-specialties (Human Biosciences [Biochemistry], Human Biosciences [Nutrition], Human Biosciences [Health and Disease], Human Biosciences [Gene Regulation]), or a student-defined general Human Biosciences degree. Honours degree options involve completion of a research project that may focus on either laboratory-based research, a literature-based systematic/scoping review, education/outreach, or entrepreneurship/business projects, depending on student interests and career goals.
The following undergraduate programs are available and are administered by the Department of Biochemistry:

The Department of Ocean Sciences is the newest Department within the Faculty of Science. It was created in 2012, from the transition of the Ocean Sciences Centre, a research unit and facility that was first opened in 1967. The Department's mandate as an interdisciplinary unit is to focus on increasing our understanding of biological and chemical processes within the oceans, and how they relate to aquaculture and other applied marine fields.
The Department offers graduate programs in Marine Biology outlined under School of Graduate Studies.
The Department offers the following undergraduate programs:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1.

11.10.4.3 Honours Dissertation
The dissertation is a crucial part of the program. It involves an original piece of research undertaken under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department of Ocean Sciences (or someone holding cross-appointment or adjunct status in the Department), as approved by the Head of the Department. This segment of the program is Ocean Sciences 499A/B, a two-semester, 6 credit hour linked course, where a grade of PAS in 499A is required in the first semester in order to proceed to 499B.
Work conducted during Ocean Sciences 499A/B includes directed reading relevant to the dissertation topic, preparation of a dissertation outline, supervised research, data analysis and interpretation, a written dissertation and an oral defence. Electronic copies of the dissertation, complete with figures and tables, are to be submitted to the student’s supervisor and to the Head of the Department not less than two weeks before the end of lectures in the semester in which the student is registered for Ocean Sciences 499B.
The student will be examined orally on the contents of the dissertation, normally before the last day for examinations in the semester. The examining committee shall consist of the Head of the Department (or delegate), the student's supervisor, and an examiner appointed by the Head of the Department in consultation with the student's supervisor.

Eighteen credit hours in applicable elective courses to form a total of 120 credit hours.

Notes:
Certain graduate courses may be taken in the final year of the Honours Program with the permission of the Head of the Department.
Only 6 credit hours at the 1000 level in each of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics can be used to fulfil the 120 credit hours required for the Honours program. The inclusion of Mathematics 1090 (or 109A/B) or the sequence of Physics 1020, 1021, and 1051 will each increase the number of credit hours required for the Honours Physics program by three.
An Honours thesis is to be presented on work undertaken by the candidate under the guidance of a Department of Physics and Physical Oceanography faculty member. The thesis comprises the 6 credit hour course Physics 490A/B. Students should seek departmental advice regarding a thesis project no later than the winter preceding the semester in which the project will be started.
For specific courses and recommendations about electives, consultation with a faculty advisor in the Department is suggested.

Twelve credit hours in applicable elective courses.

Certain of the graduate courses may be taken in the final year of the Honours Program with the permission of the Head of the Department.


Only 6 credit hours at the 1000 level in each of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics can be used to fulfill the 120 credit hours required for the Honours program. The inclusion of Mathematics 1090, or the sequence of Physics 1020, 1021, and 1051, will each increase the number of credit hours required for the Honours Physics program by three.


Ocean Sciences 1000 is a prerequisite for Ocean Sciences 2000 and Earth Sciences 1000 is a prerequisite for Ocean Sciences 2200 so that interested students need to consider this if they choose either of these options for clause 6 above.


An Honours thesis is to be presented on work undertaken by the student under the guidance of a Department of Physics and Physical Oceanography faculty member. The thesis comprises the 6 credit hour course Physics 490A/B. Students should see departmental advice regarding a thesis project no later than the winter preceding the semester in which the project will be started.
For specific courses and recommendations about electives, consultation with a faculty advisor in the Department is suggested.


Not all courses are offered every year. Students should check with the Department prior to registration to plan programs.

In addition to the requirements below students must fulfill all requirements for either a Major in Psychology (B.A.), a Major in Psychology (B.Sc.), Major in Behavioural Neuroscience, Honours in Psychology (B.A.), Honours in Psychology (B.Sc.), or Honours in Behavioural Neuroscience. Courses in each program are normally taken in blocks as shown in the appropriate program table. Students should consult with a faculty advisor each semester regarding course selection.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2. Students’ status in the program is assessed at the end of each semester. To remain in PCOP, students must receive a passing grade in all required courses, and must maintain an average of at least 65% in all Psychology courses and a cumulative average of at least 65%. A student who fails a required course, fails to maintain an average of 65% in Psychology courses, or fails to maintain a cumulative average of 65%, will be required to withdraw from PCOP. The student in question may apply for readmission in a subsequent year after passing the specified required course(s) previously failed, or re-establishing the required average.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             3. Students are required to successfully complete three work terms.

11.12.9.3 Work Term Placement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1. General management of the PCOP is the responsibility of the designated Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education (ASM-CE). ASMs-CE are responsible for facilitating the engagement of potential employers in the program, organizing competitions for Work Term employment, arranging job interviews, managing the co-operative education program database, developing employment opportunities and monitoring students during the work term. The ASMs-CE work with the Department to counsel students, visit students on their work assignments and evaluate the work term.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2. Students are ultimately responsible for securing their work term placements. ASMs-CE provide support for the job search and inform students of potential opportunities.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3. A student in the co-operative education program gives permission to the University to provide a copy of the applicant’s resume, university transcript and work term evaluations to potential employers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                4. A student who is enrolled in a co-operative education program may independently obtain a work term placement in consultation with the ASM-CE. Such employment positions must satisfy the criteria for work terms, be confirmed in writing by the employer and be approved by the ASM-CE before the first day of the work term according to the Co-operative Education website.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                5. Work terms are normally 12 weeks in duration, full-time and paid. Remuneration for work placements is determined by employers based on their internal wage structures. The start and end dates for the work term are shown on the Co-operative Education website.

To remain in PCOP, a student must obtain a final grade of PAS.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5. If a student fails to achieve the Work Term standards specified above, the student will be required to withdraw from PCOP. Such a student may reapply to the program, at which time the student will be required to repeat the Work Term with satisfactory performance. Only one Work Term may be repeated in the entire program.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  6. In order to be considered for readmission, students must formally apply for readmission to the program not later than the deadline date specified in Admission Requirements.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  7. A student who withdraws from a Work Term without acceptable cause subsequent to a job placement will be required to withdraw permanently from PCOP.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  8. Students who drop a Work Term without prior approval from both ASM-CE and the Head of the Department of Psychology, or who fail to honour an agreement to work with an employer, or conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause their discharge from the job, will be awarded an overall grade of FAL for the Work Term in question and will be required to withdraw permanently from PCOP.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  9. Permission to drop a Work Term does not constitute a waiver of degree requirements, and students who have obtained such permission must successfully complete an approved Work Term in lieu of the one dropped.
