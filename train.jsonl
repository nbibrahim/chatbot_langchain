Courses in the Engineering Program are normally taken in Academic Terms as shown in the appropriate program table. Students must satisfy the criteria for promotion as described below under Promotion Regulations to remain in the Engineering program.\n\n2. The Engineering Program consists of eight academic terms and four to six work terms. The first-year of the Engineering Program, known as Engineering One, forms a core that is common to all majors. All students must successfully complete the requirements of Engineering One prior to being promoted to Academic Term 3 as indicated under Promotion Regulations, Promotion Status (Engineering One).\n\n3. To be eligible for registration for ENGI 001W in the Spring semester after completing Engineering One, students are expected to successfully complete the prerequisite ENGI 200W in the Fall semester of Engineering One. All other Engineering One students are expected to successfully complete ENGI 200W in the Winter semester of Engineering One.\n\n4. In 1000 level Engineering courses, registration priority is given to students who have been admitted to Engineering One. Other students will be admitted to these courses only with the approval of the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Studies) (or delegate).\n\n5. In these program regulations, including the program tables, wherever reference is made to Chemistry 1050, this course may be replaced by a course deemed equivalent by the relevant academic unit.\n\n6. Upon entering Academic Term 3, students begin to specialize in their academic program, in one of the following seven majors: Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering, Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering, or Process Engineering.\n\n7. Upon entering Academic Term 6, students in the Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering majors may choose to enter the Biomedical stream. Upon entering Academic Term 6, students in the Mechanical Engineering major choose one of five technical streams: Biomedical, Mechanics and Materials, Mechatronics, Petroleum, and Thermo-Fluids. Upon entering Academic Term 6, students in the Process Engineering major may choose one of two technical streams: Chemical and Bioprocess, and Mineral and Energy Resources.\n\n8. Courses offered in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science are restricted to students who have been admitted or promoted to the appropriate academic term and major (e.g., Academic Term 3 for 3000 level courses, restricted by major; Engineering One for 1000 level courses). Other students will be admitted to these courses only with the approval of the Head of the appropriate Department for courses at the 3000 level and higher, or the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Studies) (or delegate) for ENGI courses.", "source": "https://www.mun.ca/Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.txt"}
{"id": "00bb7cb162b1-1", "text": "Some of the courses offered in academic terms 3 to 8 are taken by all Engineering students, others are offered for more than one major, but most technical courses in academic terms 3 to 8 are specific to the individual majors. Students should refer to the program descriptions for the detailed course requirements in each phase of their program.\n\n9. Technical elective courses may be offered in terms other than those indicated in the program tables.\n\n10. A student who has previously met a technical elective requirement in a given semester or wishes to defer it, may request an exemption or deferral by applying to the Head of the appropriate Department. A minimum grade of 60% is required for credit to be given towards a student\u2019s engineering program for any technical elective taken outside the normal Academic Terms as shown in the tables.\n\n11. A minimum grade of 60% is required for credit to be given towards a student's engineering program for any course beyond Engineering One that is taken outside the normal Academic Terms as shown in the tables.\n\n12. Transfer credit cannot be awarded for project or design courses in Academic Terms 7 or 8 of the Engineering program.\n\n13. Students registered in Academic Term 7 of any Engineering major are eligible to apply for admission to a Master of Engineering Fast-Track Option (M.Eng.). The purpose of the Option is to encourage students interested in pursuing graduate studies to begin their graduate program while still registered as an undergraduate student. While enrolled in the Option, a student may complete some of the M.Eng. Degree requirements and potentially be able to graduate earlier from the M.Eng. Program. For further details and the regulations regarding the option, refer to the School of Graduate Studies, Regulations Governing the Degree of Master of Engineering.\n\n________________\n5.3 Admission Requirements to the Faculty Program\nOn this page\n   * 5.3.1 High School Applicants\n   * 5.3.2 Memorial University of Newfoundland Applicants\n   * 5.3.3 Transfer Applicants\nAn applicant must be eligible for admission or readmission to the University in a category as defined in the Calendar section University Regulations (Undergraduate), Categories of Applicants, Admission Criteria and Other Information.

Students may elect to complete an Honours Program in Biology or one of the Joint Honours Programs listed at the start of the Biology section of the Calendar. Programs of students taking Honours shall be drawn up in consultation with the student's supervisor, and must be approved by the Head of the Department (or delegate).\nNote:\nSome Graduate Courses may be taken in the final year of the Honours Program with the permission of the Head of the Department and the course instructor.\nA dissertation (6 credit hours) is to be presented on some original piece of work undertaken by the candidate, under the guidance of a faculty member of the department, as appointed by the Head of Department. For students electing to take one of the Joint Honours Programs, the dissertation shall be on a topic representative of the selected program. The Department of Biology considers the dissertation to be an important part of the Honours Program.\nThe dissertation will be based on a 6 credit hours course (Biology 499A/499B). It will involve directed reading relevant to the dissertation topic, preparation of a dissertation outline, supervised research, data synthesis and interpretation, and preparation and defence of the dissertation.\nTwo typed copies of the dissertation, complete with figures and tables, are to be submitted not less than two weeks before the end of lectures in the semester in which the candidate is registered for Biology 499B. These copies must be submitted to the Head of Department, and must have met the prior approval of the candidate's Honours supervisor.\nBefore the last day for examinations in the semester, the candidate will be examined orally on the contents of the dissertation.

Students wishing to pursue study within the programs offered by Earth Sciences are strongly advised to keep in close contact with the Department to discuss course programs before registration in order to maintain proper sequencing.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2. Students wishing to take some Earth Sciences courses without intending to major in Earth Sciences should consult with the Head of Department (or delegate) to determine the courses most suitable to their needs and capabilities. Earth Sciences 2914, 2915, 2916, 2917, 2918, and 2150 are especially suitable for such students and have no Earth Sciences prerequisites.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3. Most courses comprise six hours of instruction per week, usually three hours of lectures or seminars and a three-hour laboratory period; however, at an advanced level other methods of instruction may be adopted.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                4. The field courses 2905, 3705, 3905 and 4905 require payment of a participation fee to cover costs for logistics and equipment. Registration for these courses will be by application only and may be competitive.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                5. The prerequisites for courses 4302, 4902 and 4903 refer to core courses in the Faculty of Science. For the purposes of these prerequisite statements, core courses are defined as those courses that are specified by each department as mandatory to fulfil the course requirements for their General or Honours programs.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                6. Certain 4000 level courses may not be offered every year.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                7. At most 6 credit hours in courses at the 1000-level can be used towards the course requirements in Earth Sciences for the Major, Minor, Joint Major, Honours or Joint Honours.\n________________", "source": "https://www.mun.ca/Faculty of Science.txt"}

That is the central question of the Human Biosciences program. Introductory courses provide the necessary background in an interdisciplinary manner with each course blending concepts from biochemistry, nutrition, pharmacology, and toxicology. Students may tailor their program to their own interests through diverse electives leading to one of our pre-defined sub-specialties (Human Biosciences [Biochemistry], Human Biosciences [Nutrition], Human Biosciences [Health and Disease], Human Biosciences [Gene Regulation]), or a student-defined general Human Biosciences degree. Honours degree options involve completion of a research project that may focus on either laboratory-based research, a literature-based systematic/scoping review, education/outreach, or entrepreneurship/business projects, depending on student interests and career goals.\nThe following undergraduate programs are available and are administered by the Department of Biochemistry:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1.

Students should seek departmental advice regarding a thesis project no later than the winter preceding the semester in which the project will be started.\nFor specific courses and recommendations about electives, consultation with a faculty advisor in the Department is suggested.\n \n________________\n\n\n11.11.4 Major in Environmental Physics\nAs a component of the Degree Regulations for the General Degree of Bachelor of Science, students shall successfully complete the following requirements:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1.
