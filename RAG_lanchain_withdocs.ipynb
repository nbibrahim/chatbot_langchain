Courses in the Engineering Program are normally taken in Academic Terms as shown in the appropriate program table. Students must satisfy the criteria for promotion as described below under Promotion Regulations to remain in the Engineering program.\\n\\n2. The Engineering Program consists of eight academic terms and four to six work terms. The first-year of the Engineering Program, known as Engineering One, forms a core that is common to all majors. All students must successfully complete the requirements of Engineering One prior to being promoted to Academic Term 3 as indicated under Promotion Regulations, Promotion Status (Engineering One).\\n\\n3. To be eligible for registration for ENGI 001W in the Spring semester after completing Engineering One, students are expected to successfully complete the prerequisite ENGI 200W in the Fall semester of Engineering One. All other Engineering One students are expected to successfully complete ENGI 200W in the Winter semester of Engineering One.\\n\\n4. In 1000 level Engineering courses, registration priority is given to students who have been admitted to Engineering One. Other students will be admitted to these courses only with the approval of the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Studies) (or delegate).\\n\\n5. In these program regulations, including the program tables, wherever reference is made to Chemistry 1050, this course may be replaced by a course deemed equivalent by the relevant academic unit.\\n\\n6. Upon entering Academic Term 3, students begin to specialize in their academic program, in one of the following seven majors: Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering, Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering, or Process Engineering.\\n\\n7. Upon entering Academic Term 6, students in the Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering majors may choose to enter the Biomedical stream. Upon entering Academic Term 6, students in the Mechanical Engineering major choose one of five technical streams: Biomedical, Mechanics and Materials, Mechatronics, Petroleum, and Thermo-Fluids. Upon entering Academic Term 6, students in the Process Engineering major may choose one of two technical streams: Chemical and Bioprocess, and Mineral and Energy Resources.\\n\\n8. Courses offered in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science are restricted to students who have been admitted or promoted to the appropriate academic term and major (e.g., Academic Term 3 for 3000 level courses, restricted by major; Engineering One for 1000 level courses). Other students will be admitted to these courses only with the approval of the Head of the appropriate Department for courses at the 3000 level and higher, or the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Studies) (or delegate) for ENGI courses.\\n\\nSome of the courses offered in academic terms 3 to 8 are taken by all Engineering students, others are offered for more than one major, but most technical courses in academic terms 3 to 8 are specific to the individual majors. Students should refer to the program descriptions for the detailed course requirements in each phase of their program.\\n\\n9. Technical elective courses may be offered in terms other than those indicated in the program tables.\\n\\n10. A student who has previously met a technical elective requirement in a given semester or wishes to defer it, may request an exemption or deferral by applying to the Head of the appropriate Department. A minimum grade of 60% is required for credit to be given towards a student’s engineering program for any technical elective taken outside the normal Academic Terms as shown in the tables.\\n\\n11.

Students registered in Academic Term 7 of any Engineering major are eligible to apply for admission to a Master of Engineering Fast-Track Option (M.Eng.). The purpose of the Option is to encourage students interested in pursuing graduate studies to begin their graduate program while still registered as an undergraduate student. While enrolled in the Option, a student may complete some of the M.Eng. Degree requirements and potentially be able to graduate earlier from the M.Eng. Program. For further details and the regulations regarding the option, refer to the School of Graduate Studies, Regulations Governing the Degree of Master of Engineering.\\n\\n________________\\n5.3 Admission Requirements to the Faculty Program\\nOn this page\\n   * 5.3.1 High School Applicants\\n   * 5.3.2 Memorial University of Newfoundland Applicants\\n   * 5.3.3 Transfer Applicants\\nAn applicant must be eligible for admission or readmission to the University in a category as defined in the Calendar section University Regulations (Undergraduate), Categories of Applicants, Admission Criteria and Other Information.

Forces and moments are described with vector algebra, leading to a description of the equilibrium conditions for particles and solid bodies. The importance of free body diagrams is highlighted. This knowledge is then applied to the analysis of trusses, frames and machines. Additional topics include an examination of friction and the concepts of centre of force, centroids and second moments of area.\\nCO:\\nMathematics 1000\\nCR:the former ENGI 1313\\nOR:tutorial 1 hour per week\\nPR:Level III Physics or Physics 1020 or equivalent\\n \\nENGI 1020 Introduction to Programming\\nis an introduction to algorithmic problem solving techniques and computer programming, including basic program control structures (sequence, call, branch, loop) and data representations, functional decomposition, and design by contract.

Firstly, it provides an introduction to the fundamentals of graphic communication, including orthographic projections, three dimensional pictorials, sectioning and dimensioning. Both sketching and CAD are utilized. Secondly, the course introduces students to standard design methodologies. The graphics and design competencies are reinforced through lab and project exercises.\\nLH:3\\nPR:eligibility to register for Mathematics 1000\\n \\nENGI 1040 Mechanisms and Electric Circuits\\nis offered in two serial modules, including laboratory and workshop practice, and a team project to expose students to the concept of system integration involving electrical and mechanical systems. The electrical module provides an introduction to dc circuits, with an analysis of dc circuits used in control, measurement and instrumentation systems. The mechanism module provides an introduction to machine components such as belts, pulleys, gears, and simple linkages. The laboratory and workshop component introduces students to hands-on practice in basic laboratory instruments, tools and safety procedures.
