<p><strong>Andre Brown</strong><br>Group Leader,&nbsp;MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Imperial College London<br>Bachelor of Science (Physics),&nbsp;Masters (Physics),&nbsp;Memorial University of Newfoundland<br>Ph.D (Physics),&nbsp;University of Pennsylvania</p> 
<p>I started at Memorial in 1999 planning on studying biochemistry but I decided to switch to physics in my second year. I liked the mix of theory and experiment in physics and the idea of searching for simple quantitative explanations. I worked for a summer at the Newfoundland Science Centre in the Murray Premises (not sure it still exists, it was basically a science museum) after my first year but for every subsequent summer during my degree I was working in labs--usually at Memorial but I also spent one summer at McGill. I was already pretty sure I wanted a career in science at this point and so when I was nearing graduation I was thinking about PhD programs. I applied to a lot of places in the US and Canada and got a small number of offers. I decided to go to the University of Pennsylvania and did a PhD in physics. I enjoyed my PhD and living abroad and still wanted to pursue a career in research. For a mix of personal and career reasons I moved to Cambridge in the UK to do a postdoc in a biology lab where I learned more coding and data analysis. I'm currently a group leader at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences at Imperial College London where my group works at the intersection quantitative biology, the physics of behaviour, and drug discovery. People from my lab have gone on to group leader positions in academia, analyst positions in government, and machine learning positions in the private sector.</p>
