<p style="text-align: left;">The Kathryn M. Morrison Scholarship in Political Studies will recognize a student entering their first year of post-secondary education from Newfoundland and Labrador who displays an exceptional interest in politics and public policy, and an ability to articulate critical thinking and analysis in a political context. Established to recognize the contributions of Kate Morrison, a passionate lawyer, public servant and advocate for social justice, the scholarship aims to encourage the study and practice of politics and public service. The timing of this scholarship is crucial. Newfoundland and Labrador is facing challenges from income inequality to outmigration, and we expect governments to respond with concrete public policy. Yet, at the same time, negative perceptions of politicians and policy-makers have led so many to disengage. While we continue to rely on governments to address our concerns, many students do not receive proper civic education, nor are they encouraged to consider careers in politics or public service. The Morrison Scholarship aims to change that.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.morrisonscholarship.ca/apply/">website</a></strong> for deadlines and other information.</p>
