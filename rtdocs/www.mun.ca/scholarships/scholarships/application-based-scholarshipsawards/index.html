She is author of “The Cross-Cultural Study of Women” (1986). The terms of the Duley Award reflect her support of Indigenous people, their traditions and communities. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, the award will be granted annually to an Indigenous undergraduate student in any year of study who has graduated from a high school in Labrador. Students can demonstrate their Indigenous heritage through provision of a membership card or demonstrate that they are claimed by their Indigenous community by providing a letter from a leader in their Indigenous community (for example, an elder or local leader).

<h4>Karl Misik Award</h4>
<p>This award was established by the generosity of Dr. Karl Misik’s friends and family to honour and celebrate his retirement in 2021. Dr. Karl Misik immigrated to Canada with his family following WWII, at the age of 12. His father worked as a family physician in outport Newfoundland.

In 1972, he began practicing medicine in St. John’s and, since then, Dr. K – as he is affectionately known – has delivered over 2,500 children, provided care for thousands of Newfoundland families, and contributed to medical research.
