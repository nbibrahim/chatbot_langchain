<p style="text-align: left;">This scholarship was created through the generosity of Memorial University of Newfoundland alumnus, Karl Maxwell Wells. Karl is an award-winning veteran journalist, author, actor, and producer. His career spans five decades and includes television, radio, and print media. Karl finds great satisfaction in elevating others and has done so throughout his career and philanthropic endeavours. This is the first award created at Memorial University specifically to advance LGBTQ2S+ studies. Valued at $2,000 annually, this scholarship will be awarded to a full-time student in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences pursuing academic work in LGBTQ2S+ studies, or who is actively involved in LGBTQ2S+ matters, or have a demonstrated commitment, either through previous academic endeavours or through community involvement, to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of LGBTQ2S+ lives, history, and issues, which may include human rights issues and policy development that positively affect LGBTQ2S+ people. This scholarship will be rotated annually between undergraduate and graduate students. When awarded to an undergraduate student, preference will be given to those who have completed at least one year of study. Recipients must meet the minimum academic requirements for a scholarship as defined by the University. Applications are available through the office of the Dean, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. Eligible applicants will be assessed on both their academic achievement, and the quality and impact of their work (whether academic or community involvement) in advancing understanding of, and contribution to, LGBTQ2S+ communities. In the case of an undergraduate recipient, the scholarship will be awarded by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries, and Awards and in the case of a graduate recipient, the scholarship will be awarded by the Associate Vice-President (Academic) and Dean of the School of Graduate Studies, both acting on the recommendation of the Dean, Humanities and Social Sciences.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Robert Westcott Memorial Scholarship</h5>

It is valued at a portion of the annual interest on an endowment and will be awarded on a rotating basis to students beyond first year who have a strong commitment to post-secondary education and who are majoring in Business Administration and/or Economics. It will be based on scholarship standing and financial need and will be awarded to a student who was born in Newfoundland and Labrador. This scholarship will be awarded by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards upon the recommendation of the Dean/Department Head of the appropriate discipline.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Dr. Louise Whiteway Prize in Newfoundland History</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">A bequest to the University by the late Dr. Louise Whiteway has funded a $100.00 prize in Newfoundland history. The prize will be awarded annually to a Memorial University of Newfoundland student who is considered to be the most promising student in Newfoundland history. The award will be made by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards acting on the recommendation of the Head, Department of History.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Honourable Gordon A. Winter, O.C. Scholarship</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">This scholarship, donated by The Standard Manufacturing Company in recognition of the contribution of the Honourable Gordon A. Winter to the public life of Newfoundland and Labrador, is awarded annually for academic excellence to a student entering fourth-year political science. The award, valued up to $500.00, will be made by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards on the recommendation of the Head, Department of Political Science.
