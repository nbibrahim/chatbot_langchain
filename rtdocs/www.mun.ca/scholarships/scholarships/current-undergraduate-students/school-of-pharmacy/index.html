<h5 style="text-align: left;">Hugh Carter Miller Entrance Scholarship in Pharmacy</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">This scholarship was established in memory of Hugh Carter Miller by his grandchildren to recognize his contributions to the pharmacy profession in Newfoundland and Labrador. Hugh Carter Miller was a pioneer in establishing the pharmacy profession in the province. Born in St. John’s, NL, he apprenticed to a local pharmacy following the completion of high school and, after a few years in St. John’s, moved to London, UK, where he apprenticed at an apothecary shop and enrolled in the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (PSGB) student program. He successfully completed this and all requirements for licensure and returned to the province. He then became involved with the group petitioning government for the creation of the Newfoundland Pharmaceutical Society (NPS) with regulatory authority over the profession. With the inception of the NPS, now the Newfoundland and Labrador Pharmacy Board, he served in various positions including Secretary and Registrar. Unfortunately, Mr. Miller passed away in 1920 at the age of 38, at which time the writer of his obituary noted that, to the best of their knowledge, Hugh was the first Newfoundlander to have achieved licensure from the PSGB.
