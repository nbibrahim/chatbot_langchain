<p style="text-align: left;">The following&nbsp;scholarships, bursaries and awards&nbsp;are available to students in the School of Social Work based on the recommendation of the Dean.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Alcohol and Drug Dependency Commission Commemorative Awards</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">These awards have been established to commemorate the Alcohol and Drug Dependency Commission (1982-1992). In an effort to promote the pursuit of addictions studies in various disciplines, it is hoped that recipients will pursue careers in addiction-related fields. Up to three awards, valued at $750.00 each, are available annually and open to students who have completed a major or published paper at the undergraduate or graduate level or are completing an Honors Dissertation on addictions issues. It will be awarded on a rotating basis to students in Pharmacy, Nursing, Medicine, and Social Work with a Faculty or School receiving only one award in any given scholarship year. These awards will be granted by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards upon recommendation of the Dean/Director/Head of the respective Faculty or School.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Pauline (Eddy) Anthony-Kane Award in Social Work</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">This award was established by generous donations from family, friends and classmates in memory of Pauline (Eddy) Anthony-Kane (BSW’79), an alumna of Memorial University of Newfoundland. Pauline’s professional life as a social worker was devoted to alleviating suffering, both by developing a powerful compassion connection which empowered her clients and by acting as a fierce advocate for resources and rights. Her deep empathy stemmed from the loss of both parents at a young age and an early life of modest means. She also received the solid foundation of parental love which helped her overcome any other obstacles standing in the way of her goals. Pauline identified strongly with families that were dealing with critical or chronic illness, especially those coming from rural areas and thus removed from their usual support networks. She effectively became their support and advocate on many levels. She understood that immediate provision of practical assistance was required before families could gather strength to face the challenges of their child’s health crisis. She went above and beyond what was reasonably expected to ensure that her clients had their fundamental needs met with financial assistance, accommodations, etc., demonstrating the depth of her caring and commitment. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, the award will be granted annually to a student in any year of study in the undergraduate Social Work degree program at Memorial University who will be traveling to rural Newfoundland and Labrador for their experiential learning and is not in receipt of another award. Preference will be given to students who choose to complete their placement in Labrador. When there is more than one eligible candidate, financial need may be used as a determining factor. The recipient must meet the minimum academic requirements for an award as defined by Memorial University of Newfoundland. This award will be granted by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries, and Awards on the recommendation of the Dean, School of Social Work.</p>

Lyndsey strived for excellence in everything she did and truly believed in giving her all to work, family, friends and anyone who needed a helping hand. Her natural wisdom, warmth and strong conviction to helping others made her a great human being and she would have made a wonderful social worker. This award is valued at $300.00 and will be awarded annually to the student in the graduating class who has the highest average for years three and four of the Social Work program combined.

In either case the scholarship will be awarded on the basis of an appropriate recommendation from the Dean, School of Social Work.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Dr. Heather Onyett Scholarship in Social Work</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">This scholarship was established by a generous bequest from Dr. Heather Onyett (1945-2020), BAH (University of Toronto), MD (Memorial University of Newfoundland), FRCPC, FAAP, Masters of Public Health (John Hopkins), Professor Emeritus, Queens University. Born and raised in Northern Ontario, her early experiences with remote communities profoundly influenced her life. She was the MUN Faculty of Medicine’s first pediatrician, and spent five years as Chief of Pediatrics in the Grenfell Region as a solo pediatrician providing primary, secondary and tertiary care for the indigenous and settler children living in remote communities. Her commitment to global health issues was a prominent factor in her professional and personal life for over fifty years as she practiced, taught and volunteered in many challenging regions of the world. In 2016 she received the Life Membership Award of the Canadian Pediatric Society for her dedication to advancing the health of children in Canada. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, one scholarship will be awarded annually to a full-time student in each of years 2, 3 and 4 of the undergraduate Social Work degree program at Memorial University of Newfoundland, for a total of three scholarships per year. The recipients must meet the minimum academic requirements for a scholarship as defined by the University. Preference will be given to the student at the top of their class in academic performance. The scholarship will be awarded by Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries, and Awards on the recommendation of the Dean, School of Social Work.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Dr. J. Victor Thompson Scholarship in Social Work</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">This scholarship, valued at not less than $650.00 is awarded annually to a full-time Social Work student upon completion of at least 90 credit hours in Social Work and other courses at Memorial University of Newfoundland. The award will be made on the basis of academic excellence by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards, acting on the recommendation of the Dean, School of Social Work.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Undergraduate Award in Professional Studies</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Undergraduate Award in Professional Studies was established by Mr. Alan Rowe (B.Comm. ’78) through a generous donation to the Dare To Campaign. Eligible candidates must be Indigenous students from Labrador or the Territories of Canada who are enrolled full- time in the entrance year of an undergraduate professional program. Two new recipients will be selected each year on a rotating basis, between the Faculties of Business Administration, Engineering and Applied Science, Medicine, Nursing, Education and the Schools of Pharmacy, and Social Work. The award is valued at $2,500 per year and is renewable for up to three additional years (four years in total) if the recipient continues to be enrolled full-time in an undergraduate professional program and maintains clear academic standing as defined by Memorial University of Newfoundland. If a successful candidate entering a professional program is not identified in the discipline on rotation in a given year, an eligible student from one of the other disciplines may be selected. If no eligible student is identified from the entering year of any professional program, then the award may be given to a student beyond entrance level in a professional program. Preference will be given to students who have demonstrated financial need. The award is granted by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards in consultation with the Indigenous Student Resource Centre as needed.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Lorna Weafer Award in Social Work</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">This award was established in memory of Lorna Weafer. Lorna’s warmth and compassion knew no bounds; she absolutely adored children and volunteered as a Big Sister. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, it will be awarded annually to a full-time student in the Bachelor of Social Work program who best epitomizes Lorna’s passion for work with children and adolescents, and who demonstrates active community leadership or mentorship. Preference will be given to a mature student as defined by Memorial University of Newfoundland. The recipient must meet the minimum academic requirements for an award. This award will be granted by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards on the recommendation of the Dean, School of Social Work.</p>
