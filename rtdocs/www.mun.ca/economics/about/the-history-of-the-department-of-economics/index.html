<h4 style="text-align: left;">We celebrate that the Department of Economics, Memorial University is 50 years old in 2016-2017</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>View&nbsp;<a href="/economics/more/events/celebrating-50-years-of-economics-at-mun/">Celebrating 50 Years of Economics at MUN</a>&nbsp;which took place on March&nbsp;1, 2017.</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Economics was established at Memorial University in 1967. Before that, Economics was part of a department incorporating a number of cognate subjects such as History, Political Science, and Geography. This department would eventually become the Department of Social Studies, which included Commerce, Political Science and Sociology and Anthropology as well as Economics.</p>
<p>Initially, the Economics curriculum at Memorial University consisted of two courses: Economics 1, Introduction to Economic Principles (“the characteristic theories of Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Mill, together with some reference to the views of Nicholson, Taussig, Keynes, Mitchell and other modern economists”), and Economics 2, Money and Banking. These were intended as electives for other programs, and were required courses in the Engineering and Household Sciences programs. The instructor was Moses O. Morgan, who was actually trained as a Political Scientist. He taught all the courses in both subjects. Morgan would go on to serve as Head of Social Studies, Dean of Arts and Science, Vice-President (Academic), and President of Memorial University.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first full-time Professor of Economics was appointed in 1954 -- Gordon Kenneth Goundrey, a British Columbia native, who specialized in economic development issues, particularly with respect to natural resources. Goundrey quickly organized an Economics curriculum extensive enough to sustain a Major program in Economics. In the year after Goundrey’s arrival the number of Economics courses offered rose from three to nine; Goundrey taught all of them (these would be full-year courses; the semester system would not be introduced until 1970).</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" title="Gordon Goundrey" src="https://www.mun.ca/econ/about/Goundrey.jpg" alt="Gordon Goundrey" width="150" height="195"></p>
<p>&nbsp;After three years covering the entire economics curriculum by himself, Goundrey was lured away from Memorial by Premier Smallwood to become his Director of Economic Research in 1957. He left Newfoundland two years later, but returned in 1971 to become Head of the recently established Department of Economics. He later left Memorial for the Commonwealth Secretariat and later the United Nations, ultimately serving there as Assistant Secretary General for Special Political Questions. Nonetheless, his work during his headship had a lasting influence on the department. In addition to his appointment with the Royal Commission on Forestry in 1954-55, he was sole Commissioner on the Royal Commission on Mineral Revenues that reported in 1974, initiating a focus within the department on natural resources development that remains to this day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: right;" title="Parzival Copes" src="https://www.mun.ca/econ/about/Parzival_Copes.jpg" alt="Parzival Copes" width="150" height="189"></p>
<p>Goundrey was followed as Professor of Economics by Dr. Parzival Copes in 1957. Like Goundrey, Copes was a British Columbia native who was also focussed on economic development issues with respect to natural resources. He quickly established his expertise with a report commissioned by Newfoundland Board of Trade entitled St. John's and Newfoundland: An Economic Survey. He was one of the prime movers in establishing the Institute of Social and Economic Research in 1961, and became its first Director of Economic Research. Copes also succeeded in obtaining additional appointments for the Department of Economics; a junior professor was named in 1959, and an Honours Program was established in that year. In 1962, a graduate program in Economics at the Masters level was introduced. By 1963, there were six Economics professors in the Department. However, the graduate program was suspended in the mid-1970s and was revised in 1995, with a focus on natural resource and public finance. Students were readmitted to the graduate program in 1996-97. Currently, the program has a typical enrollment 15 annually, which is up from the five or six students that were enrolled in the program in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>During this period Copes initiated a series of studies on the economics of the Newfoundland fishery. Coming out of this research, Copes concluded that the fisheries would be unable to sustain employment for the large numbers of the population then engaged in the industry. Although, at that time, the message was not well received by the public, subsequent events have largely vindicated his analysis. While Copes left Memorial in 1964 to become the founding Head of the Department of Economics and Commerce at the newly established Simon Fraser University, he continued his work on the Newfoundland fishery there for several years afterward.</p>
<p>After Copes left, the baby-boomer bulge hit Memorial University, as it did most other Canadian universities, and the Department of Economics continued to expand in terms of both faculty and enrollment. The permanent faculty complement would eventually level off at a bit more than a dozen members. The introduction of the trimester system in 1970 led to a redesign of the undergraduate program into what is essentially its current structure.</p>
<p>While the program started with a B.A. and B.A. (Honours), starting in 1997-98, undergraduate students in economics could also enroll in a BSc. or a B.Sc. honours degree program and in 1998-99, our students were offered the possibility of graduating with a Joint Major in Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science. In 2000=01, the department introduced the Economics Cooperative Education Option. The Co-op option was introduced to provide our students with work experience and a source of income while they completed their degree. Our co-op students have found jobs with provincial and federal government departments, NGOs, professional organizations, the private sector and Memorial University. The department has taught 2,500 to 2,600 students annually from the early 1990s to present, primarily servicing students wishing to enroll in the faculty of Business. Currently there are approximately 90 majors in economics, with 2/3 pursuing a B.A. and 1/3 pursuing a B.Sc.</p>
<p>A research orientation in natural resource development continued. Bill Schrank, Noel Roy, and Eugene Tsoa, focusing on Newfoundland, have made significant contributions to the literature in fisheries economics. Schrank and Roy have both been appointed Professor Emeritus as a result of these contributions. When oil and gas became an important part of the Newfoundland economy, Wade Locke established a specialty in this area. Another area in which the department has created a strong research focus is the economics of the public sector, with contributions from Doug May, Wade Locke, and Jim Feehan. More recently, the new field of environmental economics has been pursued by Michael Wernerheim, Anastasia Lintner, Nikita Lyssenko, and Nahid Masoudi.</p>
<p>In 2013, with the establishment of the CARE (Collaborative Applied Research in Economics) initiative within the Department of Economics, the research culture and the enthusiasm for research within the department improved. The CARE initiative promotes applied economic research within the region with a view to promoting a greater understanding of the regional economies and any associated wider social impacts. In carrying out CARE-sponsored research, researchers are asked to involve students in order to improve the students’ skills and hopefully, their interests in carrying out further research in this area thus increasing the knowledge capital the region.</p>
<p>CARE is administered through the Department of Economics at Memorial University of Newfoundland by Wade Locke, Scott Lynch and Doug May. Its original funders were the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Husky Energy, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, and Memorial University. Initially, CARE received $945,000 in financial support, for a three year pilot project. In 2016, CARE has applied for another three years extension, which would involve another $1 million in research funding being available to the department.</p>
<p>To date CARE has funded nearly 40 projects. The topics chosen for funding though CARE are determined by the interests and willingness of the faculty members to engage in a specific research topic</p>
<p>In 2015 the Department became the home of the Stephen Jarislowsky Chair in Cultural and Economic Transformation with the appointment of Tony Fang, who is a former graduate student in Economics at Memorial University.</p>
