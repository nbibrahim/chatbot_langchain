				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never know how to respond when people ask me how grad school is going. So far it has involved a lot of back and forth, a lot of up and down, sometimes in rapid and disorienting succession. Some days I feel genuinely, giddily excited about the things that I’m reading and discussing and writing about. Others I feel utterly out of my depth and unequipped to take any of it on, let alone produce any worthwhile analysis of it for grades. Similarly, some days I feel excited to live in St. John’s and experience life in this new place, a place where I have a lot of family history but have never gotten to properly call home, but then others I feel so homesick and lost that I question my own decision to come here.</p>
<p>My experience of grad school has been challenging my sense of self in ways I didn’t anticipate. It has made me realize how much of my perception of myself is connected with routine, place, and the people around me, because it has disrupted all three of these aspects of my life. I knew moving and starting grad school would be a challenging adjustment, but I didn’t anticipate the particular ways it would unsettle me and make me feel unfamiliar to myself. The way I picture it, I spent my five years of undergrad in Montreal gradually building a web of associations of people and places and activities, in relation to which I defined myself. It was incredibly jarring to leave the safety of that web and move somewhere where I’ve had to start constructing a whole new web from scratch, one I know will not look much like the one I left behind. It takes a kind of strength. I sometimes feel like I don’t have to accept that, to remind myself that I’m still me without my old web, to have the patience to let things be confusing and new for this first bit and the faith that they will eventually get better.</p>
<p>The academic aspects of grad school, too, have been making me consider my sense of self in new ways. It is both exciting and intimidating to know that my work will be perceived by others—right now by peers and profs, but in the future also by the people whose stories I will be attempting to tell through my research, and even further down the line by other scholars encountering my work. I feel like I put a bit of myself into everything I write, particularly larger projects that I invest more time in. It’s a scary feeling to put my thoughts out there to be scrutinized and picked apart and graded by others, because it can feel at times like it’s <em>me </em>that is being scrutinized and picked apart and graded. The stakes have been raised considerably now as I’m getting ready to take on a huge research project and make my first real contribution to my smaller field, a contribution that will remain out there in the world for others to engage with even after I’ve left academia myself. It’s hard to stop my sense of self from getting entangled in my academic life when so much of my time and energy goes to school, and part of the process of adjusting to grad school is getting to know myself as a scholar with all these new responsibilities while not letting academia define me to my detriment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1945 alignright" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="515" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog.jpg 476w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></a></p>
<p>How do I possibly process all of this? How can I stay grounded and connected to myself even as that self is in the process of evolving in new and unfamiliar ways? I’m still figuring that out, but I have started to develop some strategies.</p>
<p>The first is writing &#8211; and I don’t only mean this in the literal sense, because sometimes after doing all my schoolwork I quite simply do not have the time or the will to type one more word. But trying to process and narrate how I am thinking and feeling, whether through typing or handwriting or recording a stream-of-consciousness voice memo while I cook dinner, is the single most helpful thing I can do for myself. It’s an act that benefits both my current self, as it helps me to clarify and therefore be able to process my current feelings, and my future self, because I’m providing her with a clearer glimpse into this part of my life that might help her to make sense of whatever part she’s in. There are many ways of doing it: sometimes I sit down outside somewhere, describe my surroundings, and make note of the thoughts that are passing through my head. Others I make bullet points of small things that made me happy throughout my day. Or, at times, I’ll just open the Notes app on my phone to complain about something and shamelessly allow myself to wallow in self-pity. No matter how I do it, writing makes me more conscientious of my surroundings and more legible to myself.</p>
<p>The second is talking. It’s easy for me to forget this sometimes as someone with social anxiety, but I love talking! I really treasure any and every conversation I have these days, whether it’s a class discussion, an office hour chat with a prof, a conversation with a peer about how we’re each finding grad school so far, or a call home to someone I love while we each do household tasks. There are so many types of conversation to have, so many people to talk to with so many different experiences that I can learn from, and each conversation I have grounds me and keeps me from getting too sucked into my anxieties.</p>
<p>The third is filling my time and space with things that aren’t related to school, that were part of my life before I started grad school, and that make me happy. Each night when I’m done working, I put on a crime drama, eat unhealthy snacks and hang out with my guinea pigs, who have lived with me for three years between five different houses. We’ve had this same pre-bedtime routine for almost the whole time I’ve had them and having that kind of constant has gone a long way in making me feel like myself. Music is another thing that helps me: listening to a familiar album while I work, choosing music that fits the scenery when I go for walks, or occasionally nipping down to Fred’s Records to treat myself to an album I like on vinyl are all things that make me feel connected to myself. And keeping tangible traces of the things I care about around me is so helpful: I’ve been lucky to have been able to visit home twice since moving here in July, and both times after getting back I had some photos from those trips printed and put them in a photo album that I keep on my desk. It’s a physical reminder that my life is much more than just school, and that the people and places that mean so much to me are still out there. The big plus side of being in a new place and not having much free time really is the way it’s been teaching me to consciously appreciate the important things in my life in small but consistent ways.</p>
<p>Grad school is an exciting, intimidating, unfamiliar experience. It will inevitably change me in some ways, which is a bit of a scary thought, but it’s not all I am, it’s not forever, and I don’t have to lose track of myself in it. Moving far away from home has forced me to get comfortable not being comfortable, to find new ways to create comfort for myself amidst it all and try to maintain a sense of connection to my own core self even as I am evolving and constantly finding myself in challenging new situations without many of the sources of familiarity that have kept me grounded up to this point. I’m still figuring it all out, but that doesn’t mean I’m failing, and I’m looking forward to getting to know the version of me that comes out of this experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What do you want to do after you finish your degree? </em>As I enter the second year of my master’s, this question pops up more and more often. Similar to the inescapable <em>what do you want to be when you grow up </em>of elementary school days<em>, </em>these questions teach us from a young age that we are always supposed to know our next step. <strong>We are meant to feel that who we are in the present is defined by our future goals.</strong> The difference is that when you’re in second grade, answering “the lady in the toothpaste commercial,” will likely satisfy the question, without the pressure of following through. When you’re a grad student, however, it can suddenly feel like an unsolicited interrogation.</p>
<p>I applied to university without a clear vision of what I wanted in the future. I started my undergraduate degree in one program and switched to another in my second year. I thought of studying film, then creative writing, then anthropology. I ended up majoring in zoology. I changed courses and directions so many times that I tacked on another year to graduate in five years instead of the expected four. I entered my master’s thinking I wanted one career, and I am now exploring options that are seemingly unrelated to my current field of study.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is a fault of my own indecision but rather a product of having many interests. However, it can be isolating to think everyone around you is “on their path”, and you’re still trying to find the entrance to yours. <strong>While at times it feels like everyone else has got it figured out, I’m willing to bet that there are many others out there who feel like me.</strong> I’m no expert in dealing with the discomforts of the unknown, but there are a few pieces of advice I have picked up from books, friends, family, and strangers that helped me and can hopefully offer comfort to someone else.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You made the best decision with the information you had at the time.<br />
</em>It can be hard not to look back and regret certain decisions, wish you had made different choices, or linger on “what ifs”. Each step, even if it felt like a stumble, brought you to where you stand today.</li>
<li><em>The best kind of learning is living.<br />
</em>Even if the future feels daunting, where you are right now is an opportunity for personal growth, living a fulfilling life, and learning more about the world around you.</li>
<li><em>Let your gut be your guide.<br />
</em>If and when you do feel pulled in a particular direction, chase after it. It is never too late to change your mind, change your course, or change your career, no matter how scary that seems.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past, I envied those with a set path, the people who knew what they wanted next and the steps it would take to get there. <strong>Now, I look excitedly towards the endless possibility of pathways in front of me, I value the lessons I’ve learned along the way, and I savour the experiences of the present.</strong></p>
<p>All this to say, it’s perfectly okay not to know what’s next. It’s okay not to have a five-year plan. Maybe you have a three-month plan instead. You might not even know what you’re having for lunch today. It’s okay if <em>what you want to be when you grow up </em>is what you’re doing right now.</p>
<p><em>What do you want to do next? </em>I used to cringe when I sensed the conversation heading in this direction, but <strong>now I am confident with my unconfident answer</strong>. <em>I don’t know, but I’m happy where I am right here and right now.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My dissertation <a href="http://rangsch.de/english/ambivaland_research_statement_index.html">AMBIVALAND: Tracing a Web of Cultural Ambivalence in Newfoundland</a> is naturally related to the island of Newfoundland. Exploring the place has been at the roots of my project and is still part of my research. A couple of years ago, I moreover made Newfoundland my second home. For students &#8216;from away&#8217; whose studies are not or merely indirectly place-related, though, I imagine the physical and cultural surroundings may easily take a back seat. Of course, winters are rather uninviting, and the long month of March – Newfoundlanders recite the first half of the year as “January, February, March, March, March, June” – does often not propose itself for exploring the place either; but the Newfoundland summers are like no others! This is why I encourage non-Newfoundland fellow students to go and see Newfoundland beyond campus and St. John&#8217;s during the summer break. You&#8217;re lucky to study at a place that flocks of tourists spend time and money on experiencing each year. Admittedly, public transport is virtually non-existent beyond the metro area. I suggest sharing a rental car if you don&#8217;t know anyone with their own vehicle. (Make sure to book well in advance for the high season of July and August).</p>
<p>Below, I briefly sketch three of my favourite day trips on the Avalon Peninsula and hope you&#8217;ll find them inspiring. Don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch if you have questions or want more information on anything mentioned in the following. I&#8217;m happy to further promote the place I love.</p>
<div id="attachment_1909" style="max-width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/01_Rona_Map_Flatrock.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1909 size-medium_large" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/01_Rona_Map_Flatrock-768x314.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="286" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/01_Rona_Map_Flatrock-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/01_Rona_Map_Flatrock-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/01_Rona_Map_Flatrock.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Left: sketch of the three day trips on the map of the Avalon Peninsula; right: waterfall in Flatrock</p></div>
<p><strong>Day trip 1</strong> (shortest drive): <em>Beautiful scenery in Torbay, Flatrock, Pouch Cove and Bauline</em></p>
<p>These rural communities are situated just north of St. John&#8217;s. Each features stunning ocean views and beautiful entries to different sections of the <a href="https://www.eastcoasttrail.com/en/index.aspx">East Coast Trail</a> (ECT), one of the most beautiful trail systems in North America. In Torbay, take a right turn onto Lower Street to the beach; or drive out to the little harbour in Tapper&#8217;s Cove and enter the ECT from there. In Flatrock, enjoy the view from the outlook across from St. Michael&#8217;s church. A little further on the main road and down Hickey&#8217;s Lane, the ECT takes you past amazing rock formations and a waterfall in only a few steps. In Pouch Cove, park the car at the ballpark and enter the trail from Bald Head Lane a little further down the main road. After a short walk through the woods, the scene opens up to stunning coastal views. A short climb up provides an amazing overview. If you&#8217;re up for art, contact James Baird ahead of your visit to view the gallery and artist retreat of the <a href="https://www.pouchcove.org/">Pouch Cove Foundation</a>. Bauline, other than the other three communities, sits on the western side of this finger of the Avalon Peninsula and offers afternoon sun over Conception Bay as well as more ECT to the north and south. If you have time and more exploratory spirits, drive to Portugal Cove from there and take the ferry for a tour around Bell Island before heading back to town. Avoid rush hour (around and after 5:00 pm) on weekdays, as there will be long lineups.</p>
<p><strong>Day trip 2</strong> (classical day trip): <em>Whale watching from Mobile, history and scenery in La Manche and Ferryland</em></p>
<p>For whale and puffin watching, I recommend <a href="https://mollybawn.com/">Molly Bawn Tours.</a> The tour is operated on a small boat that takes a maximum of twelve passengers and features a marine biologist and a whale sniffing shetland sheepdog. It leaves from Mobile for its 1:15 hour tour of the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve. Afterwards, continue on Route 10 south to La Manche. (Go past &#8216;La Manche Provincial Park&#8217; and follow the green sign simply stating &#8216;La Manche.&#8217;) Walk down to the beautiful bay that features the remainders of a resettled community and a suspension bridge. Further south along Route 10, you&#8217;ll reach Ferryland, the site of a seventeenth-century fishing colony, and a scenic lighthouse on a narrow land tongue with amazing views. If you continue driving south from there, the “Irish Loop” will take you to Trepassey and St. Vincent and back to St. John&#8217;s via the Salmonier Line and the Trans Canada Highway. While there are beautiful spots all along the way, the trip can get lengthy which is why I recommend heading back north to St. John&#8217;s from Ferryland.</p>

<p><strong>Day trip 3</strong> (quite a drive but worth it): <em>World History and scenic beauty in Ship Harbour and Placentia, oil platform construction in Argentia</em></p>
<p>Take the Trans Canada Highway East all the way to Whitbourne and exit onto Route 100 to Placentia and the Argentia Ferry. In Dunville, take Route 102 to Ship Harbour. A sign already announces what you&#8217;ll find after twenty-four kilometres of curvy tertiary roads and four more kilometres of gravel road: the bay where, in August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill met in secrecy to stipulate the Atlantic Charter, an important stepping stone in the joining of allied forces against the Hitler Regime and the basis for the creation of the United Nations. Besides being pregnant with world history, the place is stunningly beautiful and perfect for a picnic. Back on Route 100, it is then only a few more kilometres to <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/nl/castlehill">Castle Hill</a>, the site of the first fortification in Newfoundland, built by the French in 1693. Fort Royal does not only offer history, though but amazing views overlooking Placentia and some beautiful walking trails too. The trip is complemented with a contrasting element by visiting nearby Argentia, the former U.S. Navy base across from Ship Harbour. Today, the place hosts the terminal for the summer ferry to and from Nova Scotia as well as the dry dock where the West White Rose oil platform is being constructed. Besides the immense concrete gravity structure, you&#8217;ll find some of what, to me, look like the world&#8217;s largest cranes – and all this amidst an otherwise apparently pristine nature! If you&#8217;re still up for more, follow Route 100 all the way south to <a href="https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/top-destinations/cape-st-marys">Cape St. Mary&#8217;s Ecological Reserve</a>, where a large colony of gannets are raising their chicks on a sea stack just metres from an onshore outlook. Driving home from there in the dusk or dark, be moose alert!</p>
<div id="attachment_1911" style="max-width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03_Rona_Ship_Harbour_Placentia.jpg"><img class="size-medium_large wp-image-1911" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03_Rona_Ship_Harbour_Placentia-768x254.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="232" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03_Rona_Ship_Harbour_Placentia-768x254.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03_Rona_Ship_Harbour_Placentia-300x99.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03_Rona_Ship_Harbour_Placentia.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Left: Atlantic Charter memorial site in Ship Harbour; right: Castle Hill overlooking Placentia</p></div>
<p>Other places on the Avalon absolutely worth seeing include Heart&#8217;s Content in Trinity Bay, where the first transatlantic telegraph cable was landed from Ireland in 1866, the vibrant fishing community of Bay de Verde and Salmon Cove Sands. Indeed, all three could be combined into another day trip. Check it out! Finally, a cool website for “places wonderous, obscure, and off-the-beaten-path” all over Newfoundland that I have just come across myself is &#8216;<a href="https://www.hiddennewfoundland.ca/">Hidden Newfoundland</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much to see and do during a Newfoundland summer! Luckily fall is usually beautiful too. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Day one. We loaded the boat and filled all available cabinets, cubbies, and engine rooms with enough research material to last for 5 months. The boat seems unbelievably huge right now, but I know that after a month at sea it will feel like a small home. I have the same thoughts about the crew members and scientists. There are 80 of us on board and it’s odd to think that I’ll get to know most of them. I realized I haven’t eaten in front of anyone in over a year, and let&#8217;s just say I will have to work on my table manners before dining with the captain, but other than that it feels refreshing to isolate with 80 strangers on a boat in the Arctic. Are we going to leave here still as strangers, co-workers that have spent too much time together, or lifelong friends? </em></p>
<div id="attachment_1895" style="max-width: 685px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ship.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1895" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ship-768x431.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="379" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ship-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ship-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ship-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ship.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Dr. Dave Cote (DFO NL)</p></div>
<p>It was the summer of 2021, I boarded the <em>CCGS Amundsen</em> and embarked on a 28-day expedition from St. John’s to Baffin Bay. This trip was the second part of the 5-month journey through the Canadian Arctic. Each year the boat sets out with researchers from all over the world studying polar ecosystems. Every trip, there are different research missions and so the science becomes very diverse&#8211;it&#8217;s one of my favourite aspects. There are people studying bottom habitats (e.g. corals), ocean mapping, physical oceanography, atmospheric science, and of course – fish! For my thesis, I study contaminants in mesopelagic (twilight zone of the ocean; 200 – 900 m) fish in the Labrador Sea and the Canadian Arctic. Our group is technically called the <em>pelagic</em> group, which means open-ocean ecosystem, but most of the time we were called the<em> smelly</em> group. Not only was it because we were working with fish every night, but I think also because we would forget to shower a lot. We worked at night and after a long night on deck and in the lab sorting samples, all you want to do is sleep. And that is what we did.</p>
<p><em>Day four. The beds are actually so comfy and we even have a sink in our room, which is very impressive to me for some reason. The deckhands and the students are all on the lowest deck,  and the higher-ups are literally “higher up” on the upper levels. To be honest,  I wouldn’t want to be up there anyways because when the weather gets bad, it gets a lot rockier up there. I’ll be okay though, I’m used to waves because I grew up on boast. There’s no way I’m getting sick.</em></p>
<p><em>Day five. I got sick.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_1896" style="max-width: 366px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eugenie-e1652368645416.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1896" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eugenie-e1652368645416.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="474" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eugenie-e1652368645416.jpg 517w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eugenie-e1652368645416-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me *not* sick.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something that I didn’t know before I went on the trip was that even when the ship is on station sampling, the engines are never off. The times when the boat was in transit became some of my favourite times because we could sleep (and then shower if we felt like it).</p>
<p><em>Day fourteen. Today we had a BBQ on the helideck. The deckhands pulled the helicopter out of the hanger and then the chefs put the food prep inside the hanger. Life is easy right now. We have good weather, everyone’s scientific missions are being accomplished, and everyone is getting along. I have learned so much about everyone’s lives outside of the boat, their hobbies, and what they look forward to when they get back home. There is this running joke on the coast guard vessels that after months together, crew members all start talking about their basements – specifically what kind of renovations they wanted to do when they got back home. On the Amundsen, they don’t talk about their basements as much because they have new scientists each month to converse with. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_1897" style="max-width: 696px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/helideck.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1897" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/helideck-768x440.jpg" alt="" width="686" height="393" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/helideck-768x440.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/helideck-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/helideck-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/helideck.jpg 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">BBQ on the helideck. Photo: Eugenie Jacobsen</p></div>
<p>We were reaching the end of our research mission and the crew was in good spirits. Everyone celebrated one another on their hard work for the last month. We all shared our stories from the trip including karaoke nights, polar bear and narwhal sightings, workouts on the helideck, helicopter trips, and the many dessert and dinner favourites. You would think that food choice would be limited on an isolated ship, but with the help of three chefs and a giant cold room we ate fresh fruits, veggies, and meats all month long. My favourites were the waffle breakfasts, the french toasts, and the cookies. I have a sweet tooth.</p>
<div id="attachment_1898" style="max-width: 693px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iceberg.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1898" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iceberg-768x503.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="448" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iceberg-768x503.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iceberg-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iceberg.jpg 802w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Icebergs in Baffin Bay.

<p><em>Day 28. It’s 5:17 am. We heard a new sound today – the anchor. I don’t know why but I have a hard time imagining the size of the anchor for this size of ship. It doesn’t make sense in my mind. Now that we are close to Iqaluit, I just received my first text message in a month. My garbage collection was yesterday, how nice. Everyone is scrambling to clean their rooms, pack their belongings, and put their samples in a secure place. We are have now landed in Quebec City, and have parted ways. For a whole month, I was never alone. I have never smiled and laughed more than I have on this boat. When I look at the group of 80 people, I no longer saw the strangers from 28 days before. I saw my friends. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing I noticed during the pandemic is that everything slowed down. On a larger scale, global closures made it hard to get anything done, but I noticed it on a smaller scale too. People now take longer to respond to emails, to complete work tasks, and more. Even though some parts of our lives are starting to return to normal, I continue to notice that things have slowed down.</p>
<p>As a graduate student, we are required to collaborate with many people, and sensitive deadlines can be very stressful if your collaborators are not working as quickly as you may want them too. I am here to remind you (and myself) that everyone has different priorities that may not align with yours. They may have family to care for, student assignments to grade, or a super important grant application with an impending deadline. Here are some things to keep in mind when collaborating during the pandemic, and in general.</p>
<p>Not everyone can maintain their productivity in our new reality. Working from home can be very challenging for some people, especially when you share your “office” with your family. The number of productive work hours may be permanently reduced for some.</p>
<p><img class="" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/old-alarm-clock-on-yellow-background-9-oclock-3d-illustration-picture-id944837866?k=20&amp;m=944837866&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=aqQrynb9WaVpE3Xgva4G8250i0QYpwSdsyHfaTHW9do=" alt="1,152 9 O'clock Stock Photos, Pictures &amp; Royalty-Free Images - iStock" width="396" height="271" /></p>
<p>Be mindful of the work hours of others. Your collaborators may live in different time zones than you, so remember to keep this in mind when contacting them or planning a meeting. Additionally, some people maintain work-life balance by ‘unplugging’ outside of normal work hours. This means that they will likely not respond to an email on the weekend or after 5pm. If something is time-sensitive, be sure to contact them at the beginning of a weekday. If your collaborator receives a lot of emails, it may be strategic to contact them Monday morning so that your email is at the top of their inbox. Keep in mind that “normal” work hours may differ depending on the person. For example, people with young children may be the most productive later at night after their children have gone to bed.</p>
<p>Your project may not be your collaborators’ top priority. Most people in academia have a lot of projects going on at once that demand their attention, and they may not address your project right away if they do not think it is urgent. If you have a deadline approaching, be sure to communicate with your collaborators so that they can schedule their work accordingly. Do not be afraid to follow up with them to ensure that they will meet your deadline.</p>
<p>If you are not getting anywhere, you may have caught them at a busy time. There are times in the semester when people are busier, such as during midterms and exams (marking is a lot of work). Communicate with your collaborators so that you are aware of these busy times and plan your work around them. If this is not possible, communicate with your collaborators so that you can work something out. Unforeseen circumstances often get in the way and may prevent your collaborators from responding in a timely manner or meeting your deadlines. If this happens, you may be able to change the role of your collaborator so that they can contribute in a way that best fits their schedule but does not impact your project.</p>
<p>Overall, it is very important to maintain communication, be understanding of the schedules of others, and continue to advocate for yourself and the needs and deadlines of your project. I wish you all a lovely summer!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being an artist, I know that creativity can&#8217;t be forced or called at the flick of a switch. Indeed, most people would likely agree that creative inspiration and production in the arts need space and time to materialize. An artist daydreaming, contemplating, apparently doing nothing appears to be quite an accepted picture. But then, artists are often considered &#8216;a special breed&#8217; taking special freedoms at the margins of &#8216;regular&#8217; society, aren&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>The central importance of time and space for contemplation and daydreaming for academic work seems less established. Yet, after all, developing new ways of understanding is definitely a creative endeavour as well, and it can&#8217;t be done at a fixed schedule or pace. This is why I regularly take time out, not only from studying but from doing anything, really. I&#8217;m not talking about reading a novel, watching a movie, doing sports, or something else that distracts me from my studies. Distraction is important, but I&#8217;m talking about freeing my mind from the task of following anything in specific which, to me, is best achieved when lying on the sofa, idling, or looking out the window without looking at anything. Taking a walk may work, but only if I know the way by heart. Most importantly for opening up and letting go, though, the idling needs to be done without feelings of guilt. That&#8217;s the challenging part because we&#8217;re trained to be continuously productive, and it&#8217;s why I thought I&#8217;d strike a blow for deliberate unproductivity for the sake of creativity.</p>
<div id="attachment_1883" style="max-width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blogpost.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1883 size-medium_large" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blogpost-768x512.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blogpost-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blogpost-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/blogpost.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of my favourite spots for the practice of active idleness</p></div>
<p>When my mind roams freely during times of intentional idleness, anything may come up. The latest news about Covid, the Ukraine, or the Venice Biennale mix with last night&#8217;s crime mystery, the conversation with a friend, and plans for a day trip with my dad. And everything is accompanied by a half-conscious whistling of today&#8217;s catchy tune. Thoughts related to my studies are likely to come up as well, simply because that&#8217;s what I spend a lot of time thinking about anyway. Eventually, I may lose track, and my thoughts will wander along unmarked paths. When two or more of them cross each other unexpectedly and combine to reveal hitherto unseen angles or links, scales fall from my inner eyes, and a new insight takes shape.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying I have great ideas every time I lie on the couch. Often, I just enjoy the idleness to relax and refuel, or I ramble over things completely unrelated to my studies or art for that matter. This isn&#8217;t lost time, though. It forms the backdrop against which moments of creativity may eventually arise. Of course, the moments when you&#8217;re kissed by the muse do not come out of the blue. They are the reward of hard and focused work; but they rarely make their appearance during work hours. I imagine them as shy creatures that need to be given room to enter the scene and only come forth into the light of consciousness when we&#8217;re not waiting for them. If we&#8217;re busy doing other things, though, we may easily miss them. It is the combined light-heartedness and open-mindedness of active idleness that generates optimum conditions for creativity to emerge and flourish. That&#8217;s why, to me, taking time for not doing anything, together with fully embracing it without feelings of guilt, has become an integral part of any creative practice, be it artistic or academic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey graduate students! How are you doing? I hope you are doing well, and Happy New Year to you and your family! I wish you all the best of luck along with peace, health and happiness. You did an excellent job last year, and I hope you are excited about this year, and rest of the semester ahead.</p>
<p>The new semester is underway, and it is important to start and maintain your plans for a prosperous semester.  Many parts of our life require careful planning such as study, as well as others like travelling, buying something new, or saving money. Of course, planning is necessary, but execution is equally important. If you have plans for the year, or have already started working on them, please let us know in this post&#8217;s comment section. However, if you are unsure and have no plans for yourself, then follow along with me and we can make a plan together.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Looking back on the last year</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Before making plans for the 2022, please ask yourself: what we did and what we did not do in 2021. Which goals have been accomplished, and which ones have not been done yet? And then, make a detailed list of each. It is important to ask &#8220;why?&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the goals you have accomplished, ask yourself questions and find the answers: &#8220;Why did we accomplish this goal? Was it on our own or do we need to thank others for help? Can we do it better?&#8221; On the other hand, with unfulfilled goals, you may also need to ask the question &#8220;Why?&#8221; to draw lessons for yourself. Please remember, a lesson from failure is sometimes more valuable than success.</p>
<div id="attachment_1868" style="max-width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SMART.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1868" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SMART-768x512.jpg" alt="Colourful letters spell out the word SMART.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Setting goals for the new year </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In my view, this is a significant step, affecting your success in the coming year. With clear goals, you can plan detailed tasks. Setting goals is not always easy; if you are serious about your goals, and you take time to determine what they are, you are halfway to achieving them.</p>
<p>I recommend setting your goals based on this principle, &#8220;SMART,&#8221; which means &#8220;Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely.&#8221; Otherwise, list all the types of goals you have for 2022: Work, study, income, family, personal development, charity, mental health, etc. Then, make a detailed plan by yourself.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Make a detailed plan</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>List at least three goals you want to achieve for each area of your life, then choose the most important one. If you still cannot select a destination, write down the following questions and find your answers: What is most important to me in the coming year? Why is it the most important? When do I achieve that goal? Am I happy?</p>
<p>After you have set goals, you need to make a detailed plan; remember that the more specific the goal, the higher the chance of realizing it. You can apply the “5W, 1H” approach of asking and answering:</p>
<ul>
<li>What: To achieve this goal, what do you have to do?</li>
<li>Where: Where will you work?</li>
<li>When: When to do? When to finish?</li>
<li>Why: Why do you need to do those things?</li>
<li>Who: Who will support you? Who is involved?</li>
<li>How: How would you do it? How will you check your results?</li>
</ul>
<p>The more questions and answers you ask, the easier it will be to visualize what needs to be done. After you have a list and implementation plan, please write it down in a calendar (on paper or using software, such as Google Calendar) to easily track and remind yourself daily.</p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s start planning for our 2022 goals right now! Take care and stay safe!</p>

<p>Time can be understood through natural and celestial phenomena. It is marked by changes in precipitation, lifecycles and animal movements. You can sense time’s cycle on a routine traverse through the woods. Breathe in deeply; the scent of decaying berries and leaves unmistakably mark time’s shift in the breeze. Tune your ears to the birds above as they take wing in response to the chilled air. Notice how the new white blanket of snow, crunching beneath your leather soles, quickly fades into glistening flecks on the shadowy trail as daylight fades. As Mother Earth settles in for a period of rest, our relationship with her and all of the life she sustains appears in full focus, lit by the growing moon. Here, in <em>Mi’kma’ki </em>(traditional Mi’kmaq territory), it is the time of the thirteenth moon, <em>Kesikewiku’s </em>(Winter Moon), <em>Kjiku’s</em> (Great Moon), which marks the embrace of night. Today is the Winter Solstice when time begins its shift towards the light.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3CADD7F0-947E-4AD7-B2CE-090101D097C1-002.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1862 " src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3CADD7F0-947E-4AD7-B2CE-090101D097C1-002.jpeg" alt="A snowy scene with grey skies and tree branches sticking out from the snow in the foreground." width="514" height="386" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3CADD7F0-947E-4AD7-B2CE-090101D097C1-002.jpeg 637w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3CADD7F0-947E-4AD7-B2CE-090101D097C1-002-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></a></p>
<p>Winter Solstice marks the longest night of the year as the sun swiftly arcs across the sky before inviting darkness. Solstice reminds us of the cycles that guide our relationship with the natural world and invites us to reflect on our place within it. On this day, the passage of time is visual, nearly palpable. It marks the shift into light that will cultivate new life and growth. In the spirit of darkness, and in the anticipation of the growing daylight ahead, Winter Solstice offers an opportunity to look inwards. Here are five ways to recognize Winter Solstice.</p>
<p><strong>Take time</strong></p>
<p>Take time to be present in this day. Disrupt your daily routine, and the stress it may carry, to make uninterrupted time and space for your wellbeing. Take a stroll in the woods, spend quality time with your family, engage in a favorite pastime or simply embrace the silence.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect on the past </strong></p>
<p>Reflect on the past year and the events that have marked your path to this very day. Allow yourself to remember and to engage with the emotions you have felt. Acknowledge your strength, your growth, and your many blessings. Let go of the things that have failed to nurture your inner light.</p>
<p><strong>Set intentions for the future </strong></p>
<p>Envision the coming year and your best wishes in any aspect of your life. Consciously set your intentions for the longer days ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Express gratitude </strong></p>
<p>Gratitude can be expressed in many ways. It can be expressed to family and friends through conversations or cards. Gratitude can be expressed to the natural world through close attention and care. It can also be expressed to the spirit world through offerings and ceremony. During this time of reflection, think about who and what you are grateful for and how to best express your gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>Light a fire </strong></p>
<p>Fire warms the body, calms the mind and serves as a reminder of the inner light within each of us. The fire can also help us release aspects of our past and move more freely into our future. Write down the things you would like to release and offer them to the fire. Embrace the warmth of the flame in this moment and the brighter days ahead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey graduate students! I hope you are doing well with the last days of the semester and the year. I would like to ask you a question: have you ever asked yourself what makes you different from others? I guess most of you will say “No”. Yup, no problems, but you should be yourself because you are unique. Okay, let’s start discussing some points: what makes you unique?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Know yourself</strong></p>
<p>No one can tell you why you are the way that you are. Your personality, character, and skills have all been determined by your experiences in life. But do not forget that your life experiences may not be the same as anyone else’s. Just like you, no one else has the same likes and dislikes. No one else has had the same childhood, education, or adulthood. And no one else has had the same friends, acquaintances, and family members. So, you could not be like anyone else in this world because your experiences are entirely different.</p>
<div id="attachment_1843" style="max-width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unique.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1843 size-medium_large" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unique-768x432.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unique-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unique-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unique-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unique.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image source: Image # 2935622 by innaStokmail</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus on your strengths</strong></p>
<p>Instead of improving your weaknesses, let&#8217;s focus on your strengths, which will help you become &#8220;a star&#8221; in the future. For example, most Ph.D. students will focus on the area they chose with some help from their supervisor. During four years of Ph.D. programs, they have a chance to develop their skills in research and communications, the knowledge that will become strengths in their career. In my case, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in chemistry because I loved chemistry when I was a high school student. Reactions happened with different color changes&#8211; how amazing! I had ten years of experience, both academically and in the industry, in chemistry. That experience helped me improve my lab skills, creativity, problem-solving, among others. These skills will certainly become stronger in the future.</p>
<div id="attachment_1844" style="max-width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nhan-in-lab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1844 size-medium_large" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nhan-in-lab-768x716.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="653" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nhan-in-lab-768x716.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nhan-in-lab-300x280.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nhan-in-lab-1024x955.jpg 1024w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nhan-in-lab.jpg 1378w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nhan doing his experiments in the Green Chemistry and Catalyst Lab.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>hobbies and activities you love</strong></p>
<p>People can do as they wish, and everyone only lives once in the universe. No two people are the same. Some people have strength in art (like dancers, singers, actors, etc.) or science (like scientists, doctors or researchers, etc.). Let’s do it. You can only be an expert in your area if you like your fields and focus on your goals. One of my hobbies is hiking and I often go hiking with my friends at Signal Hill Trail.</p>
<div id="attachment_1845" style="max-width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nl-pic.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1845 size-medium_large" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nl-pic-768x576.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nl-pic-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nl-pic-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nl-pic-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nl-pic.jpg 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Signal Hill Trail, St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do not worry</strong><strong> about how others see you</strong></p>
<p>No one can live your life as you can. Life can&#8217;t wait for anyone, so you should not waste your precious time worrying about how others see you. Finally, you are the only one who decides your life. How do you please everyone? You have to know you cannot please everyone. Thus, focus on what you are doing well and do not worry about how others see you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/red-chair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium_large wp-image-1846" src="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/red-chair-768x576.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/red-chair-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/red-chair-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/red-chair-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.mun.ca/sgs/studentblog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/red-chair.jpg 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>To summarize, you are unique because of your personal experiences, personality, character, and skills, which make you who you are. While there may be others who share these same things with you, you can never be exactly like someone else in this world!</p>
<p>It seems that Christmas and New Year are coming soon, and those holidays are about spending time with family and friends to create happy memories. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2022 to everyone!</p>
<p>I wish you all the best with happiness, health, and peace. May you always be yourself, and I hope your dreams will come true soon.</p>
