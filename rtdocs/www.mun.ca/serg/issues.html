<p>&quot;<em>The first, section 5.1, prohibits persons or vessels from depositing harmful substances in waters or areas frequented by migratory birds, unless the deposit is authorized under the Canada Shipping Act or another federal statute, or by the Environment Minister for scientific purposes.  </em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>New section 5.4 creates an obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure a vessel&rsquo;s compliance with the section 5.1 prohibition against deposits harmful to migratory birds.  The section applies to every master, chief engineer, owner and operator of a vessel, and, if the vessel is owned by a corporation, to its directors and officers who are able to influence related activities.  Section 5.5 adds the requirement that directors and officers of corporations take all reasonable care to ensure the corporation&rsquo;s compliance with the bill and any regulations made under it.</em>&quot;</p>
