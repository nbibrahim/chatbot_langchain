Beyond this, researchers are looking into potential uses for BMIs in various non-medical applications, from human performance augmentation to neuromarketing. In an upcoming public lecture, Memorial University’s Dr. Sarah Power will dive deeper into what brain-machine interfaces are, how they work, the current state-of-the-art and the potential applications for persons with disabilities and the general population. She will also discuss some important ethical issues involved in these technologies. Hosted by the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Memorial and the Professional Engineers &amp;amp; Geoscientists N.L., the event will be held virtually on Wednesday, Nov. 24, at 7 p.m. (NST).

<p><strong>Ref. No.:&nbsp;56</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Memorial University receives federal and provincial funding for the new Centre for Artificial Intelligence.</strong></span></p>
<p>The Honourable Seamus O'Regan Jr., Minister of Labour and Member of Parliament for St. John's South-Mount Pearl, on behalf of the Honourable Ginette Petitpas Taylor, Minister of Official Languages and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), and the Honourable Andrew Furey, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, today announced funding for a new Centre for Artificial Intelligence at Memorial University that will serve as a collaborative teaching, outreach and continuing education space for the province's growing sector in information and communications technologies sector.</p>
<p>The total project cost is $1,925,000, with $995,000 from the Government of Canada, through ACOA; $432,000 from the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador's Department of Industry Energy and Technology; and $498,000 from Memorial University.</p>
<p>Additional money is expected from revenues generated by three new course-based graduate programs in software engineering, artificial intelligence and data science, as well as continuing education via short courses, to sustain the long-term activities of the centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Newfoundland and Labrador's tech sector punches above its weight. With the support of<br>Memorial University, we're thriving," said Minister O'Regan. "A new Centre for Artificial<br>Intelligence will help us take on the world."<br><br>"Collaboration across the industry, government, community and post-secondary institutions, combined with strategic investments, are critical in driving greater innovation and technology development," said Premier Furey. "Supporting Memorial University's new master's programs builds on that spirit of collaboration and will contribute to developing a highly educated and skilled workforce for this expanding industry."<br><br>"Memorial University has a critical role to play in developing the Newfoundland and Labrador economy, and the province's emerging tech sector is anticipated to be at the forefront of future growth," said Dr. Vianne Timmons, president and vice-chancellor of Memorial University. "The new Memorial Centre for Artificial Intelligence will provide the highly skilled people needed to move this field forward and address the demands of a sector that will increasingly impact&nbsp;our daily lives."<br><br>The centre will build partnerships with industry and the province's entrepreneurial ecosystem through collaborative projects, outreach and continuing education, particularly in AI and computer-related courses.

<p>The MATE Center’s annual ROV competition, now in its 20th year, challenges international high<br>school and post-secondary students to learn and creatively apply STEM skills to solve real-world problems using ROVs, as well as strengthen their critical thinking, collaboration,<br>entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
<p>Memorial’s Marine Institute has held MATE regional ROV competitions since 2003 and successfully hosted the world championships in 2007 and 2015.<br><br>Provincial high school and post-secondary teams excelled in the competition during the last two decades. Eastern Edge Robotics placed in the top three spots nine times, taking first place four times.</p>
<p>“It’s very encouraging to see our youth actively engaged in learning about ocean technology<br>and the opportunities it offers globally," said Paul Brett, associate vice president (research and strategic partnership) at Marine Institute and one of the Eastern Edge Robotics team's mentors."These educational experiences can only enhance the growth of the ocean technology sector in our province and attract the next generation of entrepreneurs and leaders.”</p>
<p>This year’s competition highlighted the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and urged participants to embrace environmental, social and governance efforts.</p>
<p>Students were challenged to design and build an ROV and the necessary sensors and tooling to<br>support work to combat climate change, provide clean energy, and feed the growing global<br>population, monitor ocean health and preserve maritime history.</p>
<p><strong>Educational partnership</strong></p>
<p>The MATE Center is a partnership of educational institutions and organizations working to<br>improve marine technical education, provide participating students opportunities to learn skills<br>used in marine and ocean technology jobs and encourage them to become involved in research<br>and development.<br><br>Atlantic Canada Opportunities have supported the provincial MATE competitions Agency, the Department of Energy, Technology and Innovation, Hibernia Management and Development Company Ltd., Equinor, Kraken, Seamor Marine, Fugro, Subsea 7, Suncor, Chevron, Cenovus Energy, GRi Simulations, Pangeo Subsea, SubC Imaging, Ocean Quest, Crosbie Group Ltd., Cooke Aquaculture, Marine Institute and Memorial University.
