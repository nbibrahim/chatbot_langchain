<br />
I am the Principal Investigator of "Understanding the Past to Build the Future", and I am also an active member of the research team.  I have been involved in archaeology throughout the Americas since I was a teenager and am currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Archaeology at Memorial University.  In 2001 I began working in Labrador and was instantly charmed by the beauty of the place and the generosity of the people.  Southern Labrador has been the primary focus of my research since that time.  My investigations for the CURA project involve finding, excavating and analysing the Inuit archaeology in Sandwich Bay.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p> -->

<p><strong>Darlene Wall</strong>
<br />
Darlene Wall is the Health &amp; Social Sector Manager with NunatuKavut in Labrador.  As an Aboriginal woman, this position gives her a great sense of personal and professional pride.  She can use her passion for change to help her organization and her people.  Darlene has spent most of her life as a volunteer for many groups and organizations.  She believes that the skills she acquired from doing this has transferred into her professional life, giving her more enthusiasm and being able to work as a member of a team.  Darlene's background is in education and leading many different youth groups, workshops, etc.  She continues to use these skills on a daily basis as she writes proposals for health &amp; social projects, including research projects, as well as help carry out the projects, while working with community on all levels.  She also represents her people at many tables locally, provincially and nationally.
<br /><br />
Darlene believes strongly that if we encourage our Aboriginal youth with a "can do" attitude they will gain more self-confidence and be ready to find their unique identity.  She believes that research which truly involves community in all phases can truly make a difference for the future of her people and communities.<br /><br /><br /></p>
