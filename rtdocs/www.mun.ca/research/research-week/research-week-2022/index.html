<p style="text-align: center;">Sincere thanks to everyone who helped make our fifth annual Research Week a huge success! I appreciate everyone – on each of our campuses and from the wider community – who organized, hosted, promoted and participated in the 70 events. Your involvement, ideas and passion for research enrich our celebrations. It was inspiring to see so many activities. I was delighted to attend several and meet members of our research community. For those who attended events, please complete a <a href="https://www.mun.ca/research/research-week/research-week-feedback/" target="_blank">feedback survey</a>. Your views will help inform future Research Week activities. Thanks once again for being a part of Research Week and see you next year!</p>

<p>This event will take place in room PE-2001,&nbsp;the Physical Education Building, St. John's Campus.&nbsp;An exercise session will start at 7:30am in the Physical Education Gymnasium.<br><br>Dr. Laurie Twells, assistant dean of clinical research and professor in the Faculty of Medicine, and Dr. Katie Wadden, assistant professor in the School of Human Kinetics and Recreation, will facilitate a discussion on critical topics in women’s health research. Participants will engage in small group brainstorming activities designed for a diverse group to co-produce a vision for the future of women’s reproductive health and social care. The&nbsp;event will create a space for researchers and community members to discuss preconception, pregnancy, postpartum, maternal health and well-being. The vision of the organizers is to produce a collective voice specific to women’s reproductive health challenges in Newfoundland and Labrador to present to the Pan-Canadian Women’s Health Coalition.<br><br>If you are a researcher, clinician, student, patient, community member, or tech-minded person and are interested in women’s health, this event is for you!<br><br>Ever wondered what clinical exercise interventions involve? If so, join our pre-meeting exercise session at 7:30 am in the Physical Education Gym. Researcher-Kinesiologist Nicole Hollohan will lead this session and instruct us through a protocol designed for women living with obesity and experiencing infertility. It will involve a 30-minute low-impact body-weighted exercise session. Please bring water and a mat!<br><br>Did you know in 2021, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) launched a new national Women's Health Research Initiative? Come to this event and learn about it! Coffee and breakfast snacks will be provided in the lobby of the Physical Education Building.</p>

Maps of benthic habitats are an important tool used by stakeholders, managers, and policy makers to inform coastal development and conservation efforts. Video and still imagery of the seafloor is a common method of collecting information about the occurrence and distribution of benthic organisms. However, imagery data sets often have low taxonomic resolution and systematically underrepresent local biodiversity. Recent advances in environmental genomics have enabled rapid and accurate detection of a wide range of taxa with high taxonomic resolution from environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples. Targeted-sampling of eDNA has been applied to mapping the distribution of individual species, but to our knowledge, broad-spectrum biodiversity data has not been utilized in habitat mapping. In this talk, I describe our approach to combine an eDNA-based biodiversity assessment with previously collected high-resolution video ground-truth data and present preliminary results demonstrating the benefit of metabarcoding data for improving benthic habitat mapping.</td>

She aims to understand realistic, situation-based training and education and the impact it has on performance and learning. She is an instructor (research) with the School of Maritime studies.
<p><br>Dr. Jennifer Smith is an instructor (research) with the School of Maritime Studies. Her research evaluates the effectiveness of simulation technologies for maritime training applications. This involves conducting experiments using simulators to study human factors issues in the maritime workplace and to understand the current and future needs of maritime education and training. She looks at how to adapt training technologies to meet the complex needs of seafarers and how these technologies can help seafarers manage the ongoing transformation of the maritime workplace in response to automation, digitalization, and artificial intelligence. <br><br>Dr. Rosemary Ricciardelli is professor (PhD, Sociology) in the School of Maritime Studies and Research Chair in Safety, Security and Wellness, at&nbsp;the Marine Institute. Elected to the Royal Society of Canada, her research centres on evolving understandings of gender, vulnerabilities, risk and experiences and issues within different facets of the criminal justice system and among mariners. She has published 12 books, 205+ journal articles and 50+ chapters all in the areas of PSP, criminalized persons and wellness – broadly defined. As a sex and gender researcher, her interests lay in the social health, identity construction, and lived experiences of individuals. She leads a longitudinal study on the mental health and well-being experiences of correctional officers employed by Correctional Services Canada.</p>

Statistics, such as that already over one million deaths annually are directly attributable to resistant bacteria, have been well publicized. The WHO has advocated a multi-pronged approach to address this global health threat, which includes developing new medicines. Dr. Berghuis’s lab uses structural biological approaches to examine various mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, with the objective of informing the development of new therapeutic options for treating bacterial infections. Notably, they have examined enzyme-mediated resistance to aminoglycoside and macrolide antibiotics. Their findings have underscored the difficulties of drug development in the contexts of widespread multi-drug resistance, but have also revealed viable avenues to combat resistance.</td>

Angela is also a professor of communications, electronics and computer applications at Algonquin College. Angela holds a Master of Technology Management, a Bachelor of Technology, a Diploma in Electronics Engineering Technology and a C.E.T. designation.<br><br>With the increase of cyber-attacks, there is a need for businesses, agencies and government departments to hire cyber security professionals to protect their networks and their intellectual property. However, there is presently a global shortage of cyber professionals to fill the roles and perform the needed tasks. This presentation will discuss the results of an environmental scan of current cybersecurity programs as well as surveys of academic and industry professionals. The results of the study can help Canadian post-secondary institutions develop a workforce that is skilled and innovative in the field of cyber security. The results include recommendations, based on surveys of industry and academic professionals combined with an analysis of workforce development guidance publications from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, to technical departments of Canadian post-secondary institutions on program changes that will increase the number of graduates that have the skills, knowledge, and abilities to design networks and devices that can withstand an ever changing cyber threat landscape.<br><br>The location for this session will be the Marine Institute's mainfloor boardroom, room C2204, Ridge Road Campus.</td>
