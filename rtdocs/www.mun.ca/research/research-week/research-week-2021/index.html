<td style="padding: 10px;" valign="top">1230pm</td>
<td style="padding: 10px;" valign="top">In research about autistic adults, there is work being done on sexual health, joining the workforce, and independent living. There is, however, very little research that addresses the next phase of life: parenting. Comprehensive sexual health education states that education requires more than information about intercourse, STIs, and pregnancy - it must also include support for both unwanted and wanted pregnancy and information that supports parenting. What literature is available about the intersection of parenting and disability typically involves child protection interventions. However, relying on foster care services, grandparents, or other extended family members to fill the gap is a poor substitute for preparedness. Based on cues from the National Research Center for Parents with Disabilities (NRCPD) in the United States, Andrew Dixon is undertaking an Interdisciplinary PhD project that will investigate supports for autistic parents. Andrew Dixon, BA, M.Phil., is an Interdisciplinary PhD Candidate (Anthropology, Bioethics, and Sociology) with a focus on Disability Studies. <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81280155506?pwd=MXpUZXI0a1RVRXVwMXVvcDl5UlRMZz09/" target="_blank">To join this session via Zoom, please see here</a>.

Former Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, Sheila Watt Cloutier (2010), writes that character is built by the Arctic environment and maintains that education has a key role to play in responding to the impacts of climate change being witnessed across the north. This presentation is based on a special issue of Memorial University’s education journal The Morning Watch, and offers a look at education across the Arctic with voices of teacher educators from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Faroe Islands, Alaska, Labrador (Canada), and Nunavut (Canada). The authors from across these northern regions will share their research, centering the significance of place-based pedagogies in learning and mental well-being, the importance of teacher education in preparing teachers for their role with northern children, and the challenge of integrating traditional Indigenous knowledges with the demands of globalization.

<td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;" valign="top">1030am-noon</td>
<td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;" valign="top">ACENET is hosting this free virtual session.&nbsp;Computational Fluid Dynamics, or CFD, is the science of using numerical methods and computers to solve a set of partial differential equations to quantitatively predict fluid flow or heat transfer in an application. It is used in a variety of fields, from aero/hydrodynamics to energy, combustion, environmental flows, biomedical engineering and many more. Using CFD simulations significantly reduces the number of design prototypes required, saving considerable time and money in the design process – accounting for its rising importance in R&amp;D. For example, when a boat builder designs a new vessel, it can use CFD simulations at each design iteration to test the performance of the vessel under different conditions before proceeding to the physical prototype stage. There are numerous CFD software packages, both commercial and open-source (free), the suitability of each based on the user’s knowledge, budget, and intended application. This presentation will provide an overview of some of the most popular CFD packages, their capabilities, and pros and cons, to help you choose the one that will work best for your company. Registration details, and more information, is <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/computational-fluid-dynamics-an-overview-of-popular-software-packages-tickets-181025771957/" target="_blank">available online</a>.</td>

<td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;" valign="top">3pm</td>
<td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;" valign="top">Dr. Richard Buote will discuss three related research projects that look at chronic disease in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador. Firstly, Dr. Buote's doctoral research examined factors associated with glycemic control, hospitalization, and mortality among NL residents with diabetes mellitus. Within this project, he examined the effect of family physician turnover on patients with diabetes in NL. Related to this project, he worked on a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of NL adults with diabetes mellitus. This descriptive analysis showed that diabetes is more prevalent in rural parts of the province and that rural residents have worse clinical outcomes than their urban counterparts. For many in this province, recommended targets for diabetes management were not being met. Finally, to inform the development of provincial strategies to meet these clear challenges in disease management, Dr. Buote and a team from Memorial University also looked at how chronic disease outcomes relate to the availability of primary healthcare services. They examined the availability of publicly funded primary healthcare programs/services delivered by the four provincial regional health authorities and found considerable variability in the range of services available to patients, with limited delivery of some programs and services. Richard Buote recently completed his PhD in Memorial University's Division of Community Health and Humanities and holds a Master's of Science in Kinesiology, also from Memorial University. <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85350110230?pwd=akYwQmFPVUNLK2RXM1ZJUy9DRVkwUT09/" target="_blank">To join this session via Zoom, please see here</a>.&nbsp;Meeting ID: 853 5011 0230 Passcode: 806322</td>

<td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;" valign="top">11am-noon</td>
<td style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;" valign="top">This event is hosted by the Newfoundland and Labrador Centre for Health Information, Eastern Health, Central Health, Western Health, and Labrador Grenfell Health.<br><br>For anyone who missed our presentation as part of Memorial's Research Week 2020, this session is a great overview of how to navigate approval processes to access health data for secondary use in NL. This session will focus on a collaboration by five health data custodians in NL: Newfoundland and Labrador Centre for Health Information, Eastern Health, Central Health, Western Health, and Labrador Grenfell Health to streamline the data access process for the secondary use of health data. The goal of this collaboration is to increase the efficiency of requests by reducing the number of steps to access data, ensure data availability, further apply rigorous privacy standards, and help with ethics approval and more. In particular, the sessions will highlight some new key initiatives including the introduction of a data navigation service, the creation of a data custodian variable list, and new common application forms for research and evaluation projects.&nbsp;<br><br>How to attend: <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_M2RkMjYwMzktMjdjNS00MzdlLWEzZmItYmY0NThmMDA2ZThl%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22dcbd985f-605f-4cde-9185-fb3b938950ad%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22a9a6c040-2998-427e-90bf-2660c174e941%22%2c%22IsBroadcastMeeting%22%3atrue%7d&amp;btype=a&amp;role=a" target="_blank">The session will be held via Teams</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;please e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataaccess@nlchi.nl.ca" target="_blank">dataaccess@nlchi.nl.ca</a> to receive the event link.</td>

Senior officials from the NL healthcare system asked researchers at NLCAHR to synthesize the best available evidence about how to care for older adults whose cognitive impairment may put them at increased risk of falls, injury, treatment non-compliance, and/or who may pose safety risks to others in the acute-care setting. Quite often, such patients are closely monitored, one-on-one, by a paid healthcare worker, an intervention known as constant observation. However, safety outcomes associated with constant observation are variable, and, not surprisingly, the practice has high associated costs. Health system decision makers wanted to find out about alternative strategies to care for elderly patients with cognitive impairment while maintaining a high standard of care at a sustainable cost. The research team for this study included CHRSP research officers Sarah Mallay and Pablo Navarro and CHRSP program director Dr. Stephen Bornstein. The team also relied on advice and guidance from Dr. Anne Bourbonnais, an expert in the care of older adults at the Université de Montréal.</td>

This presentation is based on a special issue of Memorial University’s education journal The Morning Watch, and offers a look at education across the Arctic with voices of teacher educators from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Faroe Islands, Alaska, Labrador (Canada), and Nunavut (Canada). The authors from across these northern regions will share their research, centering the significance of place-based pedagogies in learning and mental well-being, the importance of teacher education in preparing teachers for their role with northern children, and the challenge of integrating traditional Indigenous knowledges with the demands of globalization.

Talking about fisheries issues which are relevant on a local and global scale in an open, honest, critical, positive and curious manner is a vital part of the research process. Organizers invite students and community members at Memorial to contribute to this conversation as we learn together and ground our education in Newfoundland and Labrador. Ultimately organizers hope to understand: what does getting "small" right mean to you?<br><br>Organizers are hosting an online symposium from 1030-1130am.&nbsp;<a href="https://uni-hamburg.zoom.us/j/65771033017/" target="_blank">Virtual log-in instructions for the symposium are available here</a>.<br><br>The symposium contains a PowerPoint presentation, where organizers will present a few stories about fisheries, and statistics showing they are “too big to ignore.” They will show a short video of the significance of fisheries for coastal Indigenous communities in Canada. This is intended to create a jumping off point for the discussion. During the discussion, organizers will have break-out rooms where each group can discuss a series of questions, before coming back together. Questions concern food justice, the importance of scale, what “governance” means, and finally, how creating a just space for fishing people relates to our own experiences. In conclusion, organizers will use the Padlet app to record everyone’s responses to the question: what does “getting small right” mean to you?<br><br>From 1230-130 pm, organizers will have a booth in the University Centre, St. John's Campus. At the booth, there will be opportunities for researchers to ask questions to those walking by or for those who visit the booth to ask questions. If inspiration is needed, an interactive method of question-asking, in the form of a couple of boxes of index cards labeled “questions for us” and “questions for you,” will be available. A zine (short magazine) will contain relevant information. It can be handed out at the booth, or anytime afterwards. In fact, the zine can be useful for years to come!</td>

This was a challenging approach with both strengths and limitations. We witnessed an unprecedented level of collaboration between scientists and regulators on a global scale, which accelerated research, bringing about new diagnostic techniques and treatments for COVID-19, as well as novel vaccine platforms. This model may be applicable to other areas of health research. We need to think globally and act locally. Academic researchers engaged in basic and applied research to improve patient care should do their part to facilitate the regulatory approval process expected at a future date. They will have to broaden their skillset and learn to think like a regulator in anticipation of challenges in the approval process; this will accelerate access to new therapies by patients.
