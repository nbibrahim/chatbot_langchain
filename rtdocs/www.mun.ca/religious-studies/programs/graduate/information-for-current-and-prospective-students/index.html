<p><a title="Use alt + click to follow the link" href="http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=GRAD-0000#General_Information_and_Regulations">MUN Calendar School of Graduate Studies Regulations</a></p>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<h5>Registration</h5>
<p>Register for Graduate Studies 9000 through Memorial’s “self-service” following receipt of official confirmation of acceptance. This step is also necessary to obtain a parking permit</p>
<p>Also, please see Ms. Sullivan before classes begin to ensure the department has your contact information and that all your paperwork is in order. Funding cannot begin until you see her to process your paperwork.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Use alt + click to follow the link" href="http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=GRAD-0109">University Calendar</a>&nbsp;lists all required graduate courses along with your program requirements.</p>
<p>To register for your courses access Memorial’s&nbsp;<a title="Use alt + click to follow the link" href="https://www5.mun.ca/admit/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin">online registration system Memorial Self-Service</a>.</p>
<h5>Choosing a Supervisor</h5>
<p>Securing a supervisor is an important first step. Prospective students should seek to locate a supervisor with compatible research interests. Students are encouraged to contact potential supervisors prior to applying to the program.</p>
<h5>Financial assistance</h5>
<p>Financial assistance is paid to full-time graduate students in two forms: graduate assistantships and baseline support from the School of Graduate Studies. Some students have external scholarship monies. Graduate assistantships are awarded in units of (normally) 56 hours. Each unit requires four hours of work per week during the semester.</p>
<p>Although these two forms of support come from different sources, students will be awarded support in a total "financial package" which will include one or both. Human Resources requires that all new employees, including graduate students, be set up for direct deposit of their pay. Cheque stubs are issued every second Thursday<br>online through Memorial’s “self-service.” At the beginning of your program it is important to fill out your direct deposit form, which is submitted to Annette Sullivan. Arrangements for payroll deduction of tuition fees may be made through the Graduate Studies fellowships office, IIC 2012. You may also pay tuition in person at the Cashier's Office in A1023.</p>
<p>Students receiving graduate assistantships as part of their “financial package” will receive a letter of appointment, following the TAUMUN collective agreement. In connection with GA funding, students should note:(1) Many students will find that they are not asked to put in the number of hours required every week. All students must nevertheless make themselves available to work the full number of hours. There must be no assumption that because one does not work the full number of hours one week this will be the pattern for the semester.</p>
<p>(2) GAs are for fourteen weeks, or fifty-six hours per unit. Students should therefore be available during exam week to assist with final exams (grading, invigilation, etc.). Students should make themselves available for such duties and not plan to leave at the end of the semester until they have checked with the person for whom they are working.</p>
<p>(3) The hiring and employment of graduate assistants falls under the TAUMUN collective agreement. The continuance of financial support depends on satisfactory progress in the program and on the performance of all duties associated with graduate assistantships. Renewal of awards requires either a grade of B+ (75) in course work or<br>substantial progress on the thesis. No student is eligible for support for more than two years.</p>
<p>(4) The department facilitates workshops and assistance to apply for external funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in October every year.</p>
<h5>Outside employment</h5>
<p>Full-time graduate students are permitted to work outside the Department or University, provided that their total workload (outside work combined where appropriate with work as a graduate assistant) does not exceed 24 hours per week. Students who work more than 24 hours per week are part-time students (no matter the number of courses for which they are registered) and are not eligible for financial<br>assistance.</p>
<h5>General expectations of graduate students</h5>
<p>Candidates entering the M.A. program or the Diploma stream should be aware of the general expectations that supervisors and professors have of graduate students. A conscious adjustment is required in order to make the transition from undergraduate to graduate work. Not only will the workload in individual courses be heavier, but graduate students will be expected to show greater initiative, originality, and responsibility. The specific ways in which these traits will be manifested may vary from course to course and situation to situation, but they will include consistent and well-prepared contributions to seminars and term papers and<br>punctuality in meeting deadlines. In term papers and theses, students must display an independence of judgement and a mastery of primary as well as secondary sources. Extensions for assignments should be requested rarely, in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<h5>Satisfactory progress while in the program</h5>
<p>The Department is responsible for both monitoring and reporting on the progress of students in its M.A. and Diploma programs. Students who are not progressing satisfactorily may have their funding terminated or may be asked to withdraw from the program. Students should thus have clear goals in mind. You should discuss any problems you encounter with these target dates with your supervisor.</p>
<h5>Definition of a Full-Time Student</h5>
<p>According to the School of Graduate Studies, a full-time graduate student is one who commits to their academic program as a full-time endeavour and may not work more than 24 hours a week (including teaching assistant duties) in addition to their studies. (Regulation 2.3.8).</p>
<h5>Definition of a Part-Time Student</h5>
<p>A part-time graduate student is one who is registered for the duration of a semester and is not classified as full-time (Regulation 2.3.8)</p>
<h5>Ethics Applications</h5>
<p>If you plan to complete research with human subjects, you must submit an application to the Interdisciplinary Committee on Ethics in Human Research (ICEHR) demonstrating that your research adheres to its guidelines. ICEHR approval is not required prior to the submission of your proposal, but required prior to any research on human subjects. For more information, please see the&nbsp;<a title="Use alt + click to follow the link" href="https://www.mun.ca/research/ethics/humans/icehr/">ICEHR webpage</a>.</p>
<h5>Two-Year Thesis-Based Program</h5>
<p>As a Master of Arts Religious Studies thesis-stream student you will be expected to complete a total of four graduate courses:</p>
<p>• RS 6100: Methods and Theories in Religious Studies<br>• RS 6110: Thesis Writing (in conjunction with your supervisor)<br>• RS 6120: Studies in Religious Texts<br>• RS 6130: Studies in Religious Contexts</p>
<p>Depending on your area of study, you may also be required to complete language courses, or graduate courses in cognate areas. You should discuss these requirements with your supervisor, and ensure that you are enrolled in all required courses prior to the start of classes.</p>
<h5>Submitting Your Thesis Proposal</h5>
<p>All Master of Arts Religious Studies students are required to submit their thesis or project proposal to the Graduate Committee. The proposal is usually submitted no later than the end of the third semester for thesis-based students.</p>
<p>Thesis proposals are generally between 15-25 pages long and include an extensive bibliography. You should submit your finalized proposal to your supervisor who, upon approval, will submit it the Graduate Committee on your behalf.</p>
<p>For information and guidelines on how to prepare a thesis or project proposal see the Graduate Studies webpage.</p>
<p>The Master’s Research Project is a 12,000-15,000-word paper that is&nbsp;methodologically and topically refined; demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the scholarly questions relevant to a student’s field of inquiry; demonstrates familiarity with key literature on the topic under study; and reports major findings of the student’s inquiry.</p>
<p>Students may submit a project in a form other than a research essay, but must first have the approval of the Graduate Studies and Honours Committee.</p>
<p>The project is graded by the supervisor and one other faculty member, either from within the Department or the Department of a cognate discipline.</p>
<h5>Time to Completion of Thesis-based program</h5>
<p>This program normally takes 2 full years (3 semesters per year) with course work completed by the end of the first year.</p>
<h6>Program Timeline:</h6>

<h5>Submission of thesis</h5>
<p>When completed, the thesis will normally be examined by one internal (not the Supervisor) and one external (outside the University) reader. At the stage of submitting the thesis for examination, three copies must be supplied. When the thesis has been examined and final corrections have been made, the School of Graduate Studies requires an electronic submission.&nbsp; For more information, please visit the S<a title="Use alt + click to follow the link" href="http://www.mun.ca/sgs/go/guid_policies/theses.php">chool of Graduate Studies' guidelines on Theses submission</a>.</p>
<p>These steps are copied from the SGS website on the final submission:<br>• The final version of a thesis found acceptable with or without corrections shall be submitted to the University within six months of the date on which the thesis and examiners’ reports are returned.<br>• For final submission, all graduate students are required to produce one electronic copy of their thesis to the Head of their academic unit.<br>• The final version of your thesis should be in PDF format and use the following naming convention: lastname_firstname_middlename_finalsubmissionyear_finalsubmissionmonthandyear_degree.pdf (e.g., Smith_John_James_122013_PhD.pdf).<br>• Click here for instructions on how to convert files to PDF format.<br>• Once approved by the Head of the academic unit, the electronic copy of the thesis and any associated supplementary files should be uploaded to the University Library using the e-thesis submission form on my.mun.ca portal. A confirmation email will be sent to your @mun.ca email account once you have successfully submitted your thesis.<br>• If required, a completed Request to Include Copyright Material form should be uploaded along with the thesis as a supplementary file.<br>• At the time of e-thesis submission, a completed Recommendation for the Award of a Graduate Degree form should be submitted to SGS by the Head of the academic unit.<br>• Students must maintain their graduate registration until all academic requirements for their degree including thesis corrections have been met.</p>
<h5>One-Year Course-Work Based Program</h5>
