<h2>Scholarship<strong>s</strong></h2>
<p><strong>A. Bruce LeMessurier Scholarship for Entrepreneurship </strong></p>
<p>This scholarship, valued at a portion of the income on the investment, was established by Sally Lou LeMessurier in memory of her husband A. Bruce LeMessurier. It will be awarded to a student <strong>beyond first year</strong> in an undergraduate business program who has demonstrated <strong>interest in small business and entrepreneurship </strong>through completion of course work, and involvement in <strong>volunteer activities</strong> in the university and the community related to entrepreneurship. This scholarship will be awarded by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards on the basis of scholarship standing and a recommendation from the dean, Faculty of Business Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Agropur Dairy Cooperative Scholarship </strong></p>
<p>This scholarship was initially established by a generous donation from The Brookfield Dairy Group to the University’s Opportunity Fund Campaign. Valued at a portion of the income on the endowment, it will be awarded annually to a student who has <strong>graduated from a high school in Newfoundland and Labrador </strong>and who is<strong> entering term 5 of the business co-operative education</strong> program at Memorial University. The recipient must meet the minimum academic requirements for a scholarship as defined by the university.
