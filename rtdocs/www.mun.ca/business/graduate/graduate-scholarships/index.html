There will be up to 3 scholarships awarded per calendar year and the value will depend on the special fee charged and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Business Administration MBA Entrance Scholarship will be awarded by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies on the recommendation of the Dean, Faculty of Business Administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Valued at 50% of the special fee. The scholarship will be issued to the student in the form of a fellowship and applied directly to the student’s account at Memorial. The funds cannot be refunded to the student.</li>
