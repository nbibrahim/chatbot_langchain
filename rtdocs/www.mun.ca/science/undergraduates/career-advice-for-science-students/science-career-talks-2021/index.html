<p><strong>Jayde Eustace</strong>: Data Scientist, Intact Data Lab<br>Jayde completed a B.Sc. in Pure Mathematics and M.Sc. in Statistics at Memorial University. She has been working with data for 9 years. Jayde began her career in 2012 at the provincial government's Economics and Statistics Branch. She developed an interest in the growing field of data science and decided it was time for a career change. After 2 years as a business analyst with Johnson's Insurance, she was able to transfer to their Analytics Research and Development Team. Jayde currently works as a data scientist with Intact Data Lab, mainly building customer retention and pricing models for auto insurance.<br><br><strong>Gillian Mensah</strong>: Software Developer, Verafin<br>Gillian completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science at Memorial University. She has a keen interest in helping women become involved in the tech space. Her first move towards realizing that goal was to move from Ghana to St. John's to begin her educational journey at Memorial. Gillian's passion for coding landed her an internship at Verafin, which bloomed into her current full time position post-graduation. Gillian has also opened her own business (GetChildrenCoding), coached with GetCodingNL, and serves on her church's Media team.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Brooke Snow</strong>: Software Developer, Celtx&nbsp;<br>Brooke completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science, with minors in Business Administration and Mathematics, at Memorial University. After completing a 12 month internship as part of the Computer Industry Internship Option during her Bachelor's degree at Celtx, Brooke was hired for a full time position at the same company. Brooke is currently pursuing a Masters of Technology Management at Memorial University's Marine Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sara Cheema </strong>- Lead research chemist, 3F Waste Recovery</p>
<p>Sara Cheema has completed a B. Sc. in Chemistry at Memorial University of Newfoundland (May 2020) for which she completed an undergrad project under the supervision of Dr. Graham Bodwell. Sara started her career at 3F Waste Recovery as a marine protein product development scientist in January 2021 and was promoted to lead research chemist in July of 2021. Sara is responsible for coordinating various research projects at various lab facilities in Canada for 3F to meet project requirements and customer specifications. She is also a graduate student at Memorial University where she hopes to complete an M. Sc. in Organic Chemistry under the supervision of Dr. Stephanie MacQuarrie (adjunct professor) and Dr. Francesca Kerton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Another representative from 3F,&nbsp;<strong>Jonathan Yick</strong>, will join Sara to speak about opportunities at the company.&nbsp;Jonathan is a recently graduated Mechanical Engineer (B.Eng) from Memorial University of Newfoundland. Jonathan has taken a somewhat atypical path from a standard Engineering student. In 2020, like most other graduates of the time, he was left in a strange position due to COVID-19. Faced with large uncertainty with his career, Jonathan opted to work various jobs ranging from retail work, being a pharmacy assistant and even working briefly with the Canada Revenue Agency. Throughout his engineering career, Jonathan has always had an interest in working in either a biomedical or environmental field. As of July 2021, he now works with 3F Waste Recovery, as a Natural Product Bioengineer, working closely with other like-minded&nbsp;individuals who wish to improve waste management and sustainability in communities across Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Curtis</strong> - Research and development scientist, The Very Good Food Company</p>
<p>Greg holds a B.Sc. (Chemistry) and M.Sc. (Green Process Engineering) from University of New Brunswick and a M.Sc. (Green Chemistry) from Memorial University. Greg worked as a Research Chemist after completing his Bachelor's degree and before beginning his first M.Sc., which focused on converting waste cooking oil into chemically identical gasoline, jet-fuel, and diesel with transition metal catalysts. He then completed a second M.Sc. here at Memorial as part of the Green Chemistry group. Greg will share his career journey, which was not initially what he had hoped for, and how he stayed motivated when things just didn't seem to be going right.&nbsp; After spending some time working in restaurants and breweries, Greg has been in his preferred industry since 2017. Greg worked in the medical cannabis industry before pivoting into botanical beverages. After needing a change, Greg now works in the plant-based meat industry at The Very Good Butchers as a Research and Development Scientist. Greg's professional interests are renewable energy, medical cannabis, natural health products and biomaterials.</p>
