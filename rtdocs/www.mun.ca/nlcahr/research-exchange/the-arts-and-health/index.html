<p><strong>November 9, 2022 2pm NT|&nbsp;Music-Based Interventions in Prison&nbsp;</strong>with Hannah Sparkes | Research has shown that music-based interventions, such as music therapy, can benefit people with mental health concerns in a variety of ways. For example, music helps people to express their feelings, to connect with others, and to develop confidence. People serving time in prison constitute a particular population in which there are high rates of mental health issues.&nbsp; Mental illness is far more prevalent in prison populations than in the community. Research on music-based interventions in prisons indicates that these interventions can have positive effects on the mental health of people within the prison setting and that they can also assist in better mental health on reintegration back into society. Hannah Sparkes has written a paper exploring mental healthcare in prisons, why music-based interventions could be particularly valuable in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador correctional settings, and how connections with community organizations can help people with reintegration to society.|&nbsp;<strong>About our presenter: </strong>Hannah Sparkes is currently in the first year of her Master’s in Psychological Science at Toronto Metropolitan University, where, under the supervision of Dr. Frank Russo, she is researching how group singing interventions can benefit people with communication disorders. She is a member of the SMART Lab and associated with the SingWell project. She completed her Bachelor of Music in 2022, with a joint major in performance and musicologies and a minor in psychology. As a part of her musicologies major, Hannah studied the impact of music-based interventions on prison inmates, under the supervision of Dr. Jane Gosine.</p>
<p><strong>October 17, 2022 | What Would be Required to Implement Social Prescribing in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador? A Master’s of Public Health Practicum Project |&nbsp;</strong><em>Social Prescribing is a holistic approach to healthcare that brings together the social and medical models of health and wellness. It provides a formal pathway for health providers to address the diverse determinants of health, using the familiar and trusted process of writing a prescription</em>. |Siham Sajed completed her Master’s of Public Health at Memorial University with a practicum project conducted at the NL Centre for Applied Health Research in the summer of 2022.&nbsp; This project involved research into why social prescribing might be an effective health promotion approach and finding out what would be involved in implementing a social prescribing framework in this province.&nbsp; Siham researched social prescribing as a health promotion concept, conducted a jurisdictional scan of 5 other social prescribing frameworks in Canadian, UK, and Australian settings, completed key informant interviews, and conducted a literature review on this topic. This resource for researchers, healthcare practitioners, and decision makers is a companion document to the Compendium of Arts &amp; Health Resources that was completed in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>January 2, 2022 | 3:00pm NST |&nbsp;</strong><strong>Why Are Health Choir Members Motivated to Join and Continue their Participation? |</strong><strong>A</strong> health choir is a choir for individuals with a shared experience of a particular health condition who also have a common interest in singing and learning music. Research on health choirs to date has largely centered on determining the benefits of participating in such choirs. Notable benefits of participation in health choirs, as noted in the literature, include physical benefits (such as improvements in breath capacity and mobility), social and community support, and improvements in mental well-being and singing/musical abilities. As well, there exists a body of literature that focuses on the motivations that drive participation in non-health choirs. However, what has not been explored are the motivations behind individuals’ decisions to join and continue participation in health choirs. Please join Timothy Brennan as he shares results from a research project that attempts to address this gap through determining what factors motivate health choir participants to join a health choir and continue their participation, the degree to which these factors motivate participation in health choirs, and whether the factors that motivate joining and continuing participation in health choirs are the same or different. To do this research, he surveyed two health choirs for this project: the Better Breathing Choir (St. John’s), and Singing with Parkinson’s (Toronto, ON). This presentation will discuss the project, its findings, and implications of these findings for health choirs and health choir leadership, future research in this area, and implications for the health care system at large. <strong>About our presenter:</strong> Timothy Brennan is a third-year medical student at Memorial University. He holds a Master of Health Ethics degree from Memorial University, a Master of Music degree in Piano Performance from the University of Florida, and a Bachelor of Music (Honours) degree in Piano Performance and Composition from Memorial University.</p>
<p><strong>December 3, 2021 | 3:00pm NST |&nbsp;Dance for Health |&nbsp;</strong>Hilary Walsh is a multidisciplinary artist and health professional who sees the value of the arts within healthcare. She began her journey as a dance artist and teacher in St. John’s, Newfoundland. Always an academic, Hilary’s love of dance drew her to study kinesiology – a field that merged her passion of dance with science. Feeling pulled towards healthcare, Hilary pursued a Master’s in Public Health focusing on population and community health. This opened her mind to view health from a holistic perspective, where environments, society, and economic trends impact health. Seeing the benefit of movement and dance for health, her goal has been to integrate dance into her practice as a healthcare practitioner. This presentation will cover Hilary’s current process of weaving dance into her work as an occupational therapist both with children and with older adults. An overview of current health evidence related to dance interventions will be discussed as well as the details of adapted dance programming vs. dance movement therapy.</p>
<p><strong>November 23, 2021 | 3:00pm NST |Random Acts at Memorial University: student engagement and music-making |</strong>This presentation, intended for those who do research and practice in community engagement programming, will showcase the “Random Acts at Memorial” music-engagement program through Memorial University’s Student Life department. In this session, Julia Halfyard (Coordinator of New Student Experiences at Memorial and Ph.D. Candidate, Faculty of Education) will talk about the role of music engagement in enhancing a sense of place and belonging on campus. The “Random Acts at Memorial” music engagement programming being piloted for undergraduate students (lunchtime concerts, ‘busking’ in the tunnel systems, ensemble singing, and pop-up acts of music), deploys music and music-making opportunities as a form of cutting edge student engagement practice. The program is inspired by research evidence for the demonstrated power of music on mental health and social engagement in other community populations, and its creators are borrowing from these successes to create positive change in students' sense of belonging, well-being, healthy campus engagement, and community connection.&nbsp;<strong>About our Presenter:</strong> Julia Halfyard is the Coordinator of New Student Experience at Memorial University and a musical performer and teacher in St. John's with a record of performances across Canada, including the 2015 world premiere of the musical, “The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz” in Montreal. Julia is also a member of Lady Cove Women’s Choir and a leader of the ever-popular Instant Choir in St. John’s, NL. In addition to her work with Student Life at Memorial University, she is also a Ph.D. candidate infusing the joy of art and music-making into our communities.</p>
<p><strong>October 26, 2021 | 3:00pm NST | Collaborative songwriting with persons living with dementia to challenge stigma |</strong>This presentation focused on the use of collaborative songwriting as a way to highlight the capabilities of individuals living with dementia. The presenter shared the songwriting model they use in practice, presented two case examples, and discussed the potential for using songwriting as a tool for social change in the dementia context. <strong>About our presenter:</strong> Taylor Kurta is an award-winning singer-songwriter, music therapist, and a PhD student at the University of Waterloo in the Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies. Her research focuses on using critical arts-based methodologies to challenge stigma associated with dementia.</p>

<p><strong>February 10, 2021 | Social Prescribing | </strong>Dr. Jane Gosine, School of Music and Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University |&nbsp;What would it look like for the healthcare system to see a patient as a whole person, instead of focusing on just their medical diagnoses? What if, along with medication, doctors and nurse practitioners were enabled to prescribe dance lessons, choir practice, art gallery visits, pottery classes, or other arts-based interventions? This kind of “social prescribing ” model has been formalized in England’s healthcare delivery, and is gaining national and international recognition. We discussed how we might gain momentum for social prescribing here in Newfoundland and Labrador. |&nbsp;<a href="/nlcahr/media/production/memorial/administrative/nl-centre-for-applied-health-research/media-library/researchexchange/AHSocPresFeb2021.pdf">Link to Presentation</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>February 18, 2020 | Paper Doll Workshop |&nbsp;</strong>In a recent project on identities and subjectivities, with Dr Heather McLeod and Haley Toll, Cecile Badenhorst and the team reflected on the role of our imaginative selves as an important part of ethical practice as educators and writers in academic contexts. Dr. Badenhorst wrote about making paper dolls as a way of exploring our non-linguistic ways of knowing and being, and as a way of re-positioning oneself in contexts of stress and anxiety. In this hands-on workshop, she invited you to join her in making a paper art doll. No skills were required. Making paper dolls is particularly powerful way of engaging the imaginative self and it’s lots of fun too. Cecile Badenhorst is an Associate Professor in the Adult Education/Post-Secondary program in the Faculty of Education at Memorial University. As a researcher, she engages in qualitative, arts-based and post-structural research methodologies.</p>
