<p>"Regulations for the General Degree of Bachelor of Business Administration <br><br></p> 
<p>Admission <br><br></p> 
<p>1) Normally, admission is offered for the Fall Term: the deadline for admission (or re-admission) is March 1. Where circumstances permit, applications will be considered for the Winter and Spring Terms: the deadlines for admission (or re-admission) are October 1 for Winter, and February 1 for Spring. <br><br></p> 
<p>2) Students who are seeking admission for the Fall Semester normally must have completed all the courses required for admission by the end of the Winter Semester. <br><br></p> 
<p>3) Applications received after the deadline will be considered only if a space is available in the programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>4) Eligibility: To be eligible for Admission to the BBA programme an applicant must have successfully completed a minimum of thirty credit hours in university courses with an overall average of at least 65% on the courses comprising those thirty credit hours. The thirty credit hours must comprise: <br><br></p> 
<p>a) Six credit hours in English courses;<sup>1</sup></p> 
<p>b) EITHER Mathematics 1080 and 1081 OR Mathematics 1000 and three credit hours chosen from courses in the Faculties of Arts and/or Science;</p> 
<p>c) Economics 2010 and 2020;</p> 
<p>d) Business 1000</p> 
<p>e) Nine additional credit hours in non-Business courses, at least six of which must be in courses chosen from the Faculty of Arts and/or Science. <br><br></p> 
<p>5) Admission is competitive and selective. Therefore, prospective students are encouraged to consider an alternate degree programme in the event that they are not accepted into the Bachelor of Business Administration programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>6) The primary criterion used in reaching decisions on applications for admission is overall academic achievement. Selection, therefore will be based on a student's overall academic performance in addition to the average on the thirty credit hours required for admission. Students with weak overall academic records are unlikely to be admitted. <br><br></p> 
<p>7) The Faculty recognizes that a candidate's academic performance can be viewed in the context of the individual's other interests, activities and accomplishments. Notwithstanding Clause 6 above, the Admissions Committee may consider extracurricular activities and achievements as factors in the admission decision. To assist the Admissions Committee in this area candidates for admission may complete and submit the personal Information Form to support their applications for admission. <br><br></p> 
<p>8) In the case where an applicant has been required to withdraw from the Bachelor of Commerce (Co-operative) Programme, the Admissions Committee of the Faculty may consider this circumstance as grounds to deny admission. <br><br></p> 
<p><sup>1</sup>It is strongly recommended that students complete English 1110, Comprehension, Writing and Prose Style, as one of these English courses. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Curriculum <br><br></p> 
<p>1) The BBA programme requires a total of 120 credit hours, i.e. 90 credit hours beyond the 30 credit hours required for admission. <br><br></p> 
<p>2) In addition to the admission requirements, the curriculum shall consist of the successful completion of:</p>

<p>GENERAL COMMENTS <br><br></p> 
<p>Study in the field of Physical Education (recreation and sport) began in the form of a two-year diploma programme in 1956 at the Memorial University Campus on Parade Street. The degree programme was approved by Senate in 1961 when the present campus opened. After twenty years as a Department, the unit gained the status of a Professional School in the Fall of 1976. The move to a co-operative education format was made in 1992. <br><br></p> 
<p>It is clear that future trends in our society towards increased leisure time and personal responsibility for balanced, healthy lifestyles will require professionals in the field of physical education/recreation who are prepared to initiate and operate a wide variety of programmes to meet these needs. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) at Memorial University is a Co-operative Programme, under which regular full-time academic terms are alternated with full-time work terms in positions related to the student's future career. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) Programme consists of six academic terms and four work terms. The six academic terms are designed with a common curriculum extending over the first two terms. <br><br></p> 
<p>A Bachelor of Physical Education Honours (Co-operative) programme requiring additional courses in Physical Education (or in approved related fields) and superior academic achievement is also available. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative) at Memorial University is a Co-operative Programme, under which seven regular full-time academic terms are alternated with three full-time work terms in positions related to the student's future career. <br><br></p> 
<p>A Bachelor of Recreation Honours (Co-operative) programme requiring specific courses in Recreation (or in approved related fields) and superior academic achievement is also available. <br><br></p> 
<p>During work terms students are brought into direct contact with the physical education/recreation profession, exposed to actual practical problems, expected to assume ever-increasing responsibility in employment as their education advances, and introduced to experiences far beyond the scope of those which could be provided in the University. The experiences should provide maturing prospective graduates with an early appreciation of the personal, social and economic aspects of physical education/recreation through direct association with professionals in a work environment. <br><br></p> 
<p>Much of the experience gained in this type of programme would not be available to students until after graduation, in a conventional programme. This experience makes a significant contribution to their total education. <br><br></p> 
<p>There are two options to choose from in completing the Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) Degree or the Bachelor of Physical Education Honours (Co-operative) Degree: <br><br></p> 
<p>1) Teaching - designed to be followed by the Bachelor of Education Degree (B.Ed.): <br><br></p> 
<p>This option of the degree programme contains courses in curriculum planning, teaching methods and practice relevant to physical education curricula for various age groups. There will be an emphasis on placing the student in a school or teaching position for some of the work terms. The student normally completes the B.Ed. degree programme following the Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) and will then be prepared for a career within a school setting. <br><br></p> 
<p>2) General Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) - designed to provide a basic professional preparation: <br><br></p> 
<p>The generalist option of the programme consists of core courses common to the other options plus a flexible choice of electives, without the requirement for curriculum and methods courses necessary for the Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative)/B.Ed. combination. This stream is designed to prepare graduates for work outside a school system. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) programme normally takes 10 semesters to complete, except for the Bachelor of Physical Education Honours (Co-operative) programme which normally requires one additional semester of study. Refer to Table 1 for the sequencing of academic and work terms. <br><br></p> 
<p>Upon successful completion of the undergraduate programme as approved by the Academic Council and Senate, candidates will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative), or Bachelor of Physical Education Honours (Co-operative), as appropriate. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative) Degree programme is designed to provide students with the opportunity to develop professional competencies in several aspects of leisure service management: conceptual foundations of recreation and leisure, professionalism in leisure services, leisure services delivery systems, programming strategies, assessment, planning and evaluation, administration and management, and legislative and legal aspects of recreation. The students will also gain an understanding of the social, physical, psychological, cultural, economic, and political issues that influence leisure participation, delivery, and management. The Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative) programme normally takes 10 semesters to complete. Refer to Table 3 for the sequencing of academic and work terms. <br><br></p> 
<p>Upon successful completion of the undergraduate programme as approved by the Academic Council and Senate, candidates will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative), or Bachelor of Recreation Honours (Co-operative), as appropriate. <br><br></p>

<p><br><br></p> 
<p>EVALUATION AND PROMOTION <br><br></p> 
<p>Success in the undergraduate degree programmes depends on meeting the requirements of both academic terms and work terms. A student of physical education should be able to obtain a work term position through the job competition for each work term. Employers are only likely to offer positions to students who can demonstrate the academic and personal qualities which fit them for the work concerned. Students must be able to communicate effectively when applying for positions and as required during the work term. Some assistance in the strengthening of communication skills is available for all students. <br><br></p> 
<p>1) The Academic Council of the School constitutes the examining body for all physical education evaluations. The standing of every student will be assessed at the end of each academic term and at the end of each work term by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies which will then make its recommendations to Academic Council. The decisions of the Academic Council will be issued to individual students by mail and will be forwarded to the Registrar. <br><br></p> 
<p>2) Students have the right to appeal any decision made by the School in regard to their promotion. Any such appeal must be made in writing to the Chair of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies of the School, within one month of the issue of results by the Academic Council. <br><br></p> 
<p>3) To be promoted a student must, in addition to obtaining the requisite marks and average, complete and deliver all laboratory, project work, and work reports as required. <br><br></p> 
<p>4) The Academic Council of the School may promote a student notwithstanding promotion requirements given below. A decision of this nature will be made only for reasons acceptable to Academic Council and in the case of a student thought likely to succeed in future terms. <br><br></p> 
<p>5) Students to whom promotion is denied are no longer in the Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) or Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative) programmes. Subject to regulations 12, 13 and 20, such students may be permitted to repeat unsuccessful terms. Those wishing to do so must apply for re-admission in accordance with the School and University re-admission regulations. <br><br></p> 
<p>6) A student's status at the end of each academic term will be in one of the following three categories: <br><br></p> 
<p>a) Clear promotion - requires an overall average of at least 60% with a mark of at least 60% in all Physical Education and Recreation courses, and at least 50% in all non-Physical Education and non-Recreation courses. <br><br></p> 
<p>b) Probationary promotion - requires an overall average of at least 60%, with at least 50% in all courses, and at most one Physical Education or Recreation course mark below 60%. <br><br></p> 
<p>c) Probationary (A) promotion-failure to successfully complete the required components of the activities course in a given semester, upon the recommendation of the course instructor/coordinator and/or the Committee on Undergraduate Studies. <br><br></p> 
<p>d) Promotion Denied - if none of the above sets of criteria is satisfied. <br><br></p> 
<p>7) A student who has a clear promotion can proceed to the next term in the programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>8) A student with a probationary promotion at the end of Academic Term 1 may be permitted to enter Academic Term 2 with no conditions other than those of clause 11 which must be met by the end of Academic Term 2. <br><br></p> 
<p>9) A student with a probationary promotion from Academic Terms 2 to 5 will continue to the subsequent work term under the condition that entry into the next academic term is not allowed until the student's status is transferred to a clear promotion under conditions outlined in clause 11. <br><br></p> 
<p>10) A student with a probationary promotion or promotion denied at the end of Academic Term 6 for Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative), Academic Term 7 for Bachelor of Physical Education Honours (Co-operative), Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative), and Bachelor of Recreation Honours (Co-operative) will not be recommended for graduation until the student's status is changed to that of a clear promotion. <br><br></p> 
<p>11) A student with a probationary (A) promotion in any semester will be permitted to enter subsequent semesters but will not receive a grade for that activities course until the outstanding items have been successfully completed. Academic Council will grant this status, taking into account the specific factors involved in each case. This status is not automatic, as failure to successfully complete all requirements of an activities course would normally result in a failing grade. <br><br></p> 
<p>12) Transfer from a probationary promotion to a clear promotion will entail satisfying the School that the student is competent in the subject of the Physical Education course in which the student has failed to achieve 60%. This will normally entail re-examination, upon which the student will be declared to have passed or failed a test of competency in the subject concerned, without the assignment of a numerical grade on the test. Re-examination may be written, oral, practical or a combination of formats. <br><br></p> 
<p>A re-examination will be at a time determined by the School. Failure to submit to the re-examination or failure in the re-examination will result in denial of promotion. <br><br></p> 
<p>Remedial studies, including courses, may be recommended to be completed before re-examination. <br><br></p> 
<p>In the case of probationary (A) status, the student shall successfully complete the missing course components before graduation. <br><br></p> 
<p>13) Students denied promotion may seek to be re-admitted to the programme, after two semesters. Re-admission will normally be into the term which the</p> 
<p>student failed. Students will be required to repeat all professional courses in which they obtained less than a grade of 60% in that term. A non-Physical Education or non-Recreation elective course may be replaced by a course acceptable in the student's programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>Where students have successfully completed (60%) in all professional courses but failed a non-Physical Education or non-Recreation elective course, they may be readmitted into the next work term of their programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>14) A student shall be permitted only one re-admission to the Bachelor of Physical Education (Co-operative) or Bachelor of Recreation (Co-operative) programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>15) Students may be required to withdraw from their programme at any time, if, in the opinion of the School, they are unlikely to profit from continued attendance. <br><br></p> 
<p>16) Successful completion of the work term requirements is a prerequisite to graduation. The dates for starting and finishing each work term are shown in the University Diary. <br><br></p> 
<p>17) A competition for work term employment is organized by the School of Physical Education and Athletics. Students may request interviews for up to 12 jobs offered in the competition. Students give permission to the School of Physical Education and Athletics to supply their resume to potential employers.<br><br></p> 
<p>18) Students may obtain their work term jobs outside the competition. Such jobs must be confirmed by letter from the employer and be approved by the School of Physical Education and Athletics on or before the official first day of the work term as outlined in the University Diary. <br><br></p> 
<p>19) A Work Report must be submitted each work term on some phase of the student's current employment. This report must be approved by the employer and be submitted to the School of Physical Education and Athletics on or before the deadline date shown in the University Diary. Evidence of the student's ability to gather material relating to the job, analyze it effectively and present it in a clear, logical and concise form, will be required in the report. Late reports will not be evaluated, unless prior permission for a late report has been given by the School of Physical Education and Athletics. <br><br></p> 
<p>20) The overall evaluation of the work term is the responsibility of the School of Physical Education and Athletics. <br><br></p> 
<p>Two components are considered in work term evaluation: on-the-job performance and the Work Report. Each component is evaluated separately. <br><br></p> 
<p>Evaluation of the work term will result in the assignment of one of the following promotion recommendations: <br><br></p> 
<p>a) PASS WITH DISTINCTION: Indicates excellent performance in both the work report and work performance. The student is commended for his/her outstanding performance in each of the required components; pass with distinction has been awarded to each of the work report and work performance. <br><br></p> 
<p>b) PASS: Indicates that performance meets expectations in both the work report and work performance. The student fully meets the requirements of a passing work report and completely satisfactory work term performance. <br><br></p> 
<p>c) FAIL: Indicates failing performance in the work report and/or work performance. <br><br></p> 
<p>For promotion from the work term, a student must obtain PASS WITH DISTINCTION or PASS. <br><br></p> 
<p>On-the-job performance is assessed by the Programme Manager or a delegate using information gathered during the work term and input from the employer towards the end of the work term. Formal written documentation from the employer is sought. <br><br></p> 
<p>The Work Report is evaluated by the Programme Manager or delegate. If an employer designates a report to be of a confidential nature, both employer and Programme Manager must agree as to the method to protect the confidentiality of such a report before the report may be accepted for evaluation. <br><br></p> 
<p>21) If a student fails to achieve promotion from a work term, the student will be required to withdraw from the programme and may be considered for re-admission after the lapse of two semesters, at which time the student will be required to complete a further work term with satisfactory performance before being admitted to any further academic term in the School. <br><br></p> 
<p>A given work term may be repeated only once, and not more than two work terms may be repeated in the entire programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>Notwithstanding the above, a student who does not achieve promotion and who in the opinion of the School can benefit from a remedial programme, may be permitted an extension of time not to exceed the end of the Regular Registration Period of the subsequent semester to complete the requirements of the work term. <br><br></p> 
<p>22) Students are not permitted to drop work terms without prior approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies upon the recommendation of the Programme Manager. Students who drop a work term without permission, or who fail to honour an agreement to work with an employer, or who conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause their discharge from the job, will normally be awarded a failing grade for that work term. Permission to drop a work term does not constitute a waiver of degree requirements, and students who have obtained such permission must complete an approved work term in lieu of the one dropped. <br><br></p> 
<p>NOTE: Students should also refer to the General Regulations of the University. <br><br></p> 
<p>23) Students who receive clear promotion from an academic term but who then experience an interruption in the continuation of their programme, must re-pass the fitness continuation test before proceeding to the next academic term in the programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>REGULATIONS FOR THE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION HONOURS (CO-OPERATIVE) <br><br></p> 
<p>A Degree of Bachelor of Physical Education Honours (Co-operative) signifies superior academic achievement.

Students should be able to demonstrate professional behaviours and competencies at a high level during this final work placement. As one component of the Work Term, the student is required to complete a Work Report. <br><br></p> 
<p>WORK REPORTS <br><br></p> 
<p>A Work Report, on a topic approved by the Programme Manager or delegate, must be submitted for each work term. The report must be approved by the employer and submitted to the School on or before the deadline scheduled by the School. Evidence of the student's ability to gather material relevant to the report, analyze it effectively and present it in a clear, logical and concise form, will be required in the report. <br><br></p> 
<p>Topics may include work report writing, work term evaluation, career planning, employment seeking skills, resumé preparation, interview skills, ethics and professional concepts, behaviourial requirements in the work place - among others. <br><br></p> 
<p>NOTE: Seminars on professional development, conducted by the School of Physical Education and Athletics, are presented during Academic Terms 1 and 2 to prepare the student for participation in subsequent Work Terms. <br><br></p> 
<p>PHYSICAL EDUCATION CO-OPERATIVE PROGRAMME <br><br></p> 
<p>General management of the work terms in the Co-operative Programme is the responsibility of the School of Physical Education and Athletics. The School, through its Programme Manager and delegates, is responsible for assisting potential employers to become involved in the programme, for the continual development of employment opportunities, for arranging student-employer interviews, for counselling of students, for visiting them on their work assignments and for the grading of the work term. <br><br></p> 
<p>Students and employers choose each other through the School's placement process. Job notices are posted and students may apply for up to twelve interviews. Employers' representatives come on campus and interview students, after which both the students and employers express their preferences for one another. <br><br></p> 
<p>Students are then placed by the School to fit expressed preference. While the School does not guarantee paid placement, every effort is made to ensure that appropriate employment is made available. In the case of students who are required to withdraw from the programme, the School has no responsibility for placement until they have been re-admitted to the programme. <br><br></p> 
<p>Salaries paid cooperative students are determined within the employer's own wage structure, and can be expected to increase as the student progresses through the programme and assumes more responsibility. However, students should not expect income from work terms to make them completely self-supporting. <br><br></p> 
<p>Students in the co-operative programme give permission to prospective employers, in the course of the interview process, to have access to their records, which contain their academic marks and their work term evaluations. After placement, students may not withdraw from a specific job situation unless prior permission is obtained from the Programme Manager of the School." <br><br></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Report of the Senate ad hoc Committee on the Teaching of Writing</span> <br><br></p> 
<p>A memorandum dated January 30, 1997 was received from the Executive Committee of Senate recommending that, because of the substantial nature of these two reports, they should be the subject of a special meeting of Senate. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following consideration, it was agreed that in lieu of the special meeting of Senate scheduled to be held at the March meeting, the regular meeting of Senate on March 11, 1997 will be devoted to the consideration of the two Reports, and that if necessary, any normal business of Senate would be carried over to the April 8, 1997 meeting of Senate.<br><br></p> 
<p>65.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Report of the Senate Elections Committee</span> <br><br></p> 
<p>A memorandum dated January 29, 1997 was received from the Committee on Senate Elections reporting the entitlement of each constituency to seats on Senate for the 1997-98 academic year, in accordance with the procedures for election of Senate members. <br><br></p> 
<p>66. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Availability of Resources for New Programmes</span> <br><br></p> 
<p>A memorandum dated January 30, 1997 was received from the Executive Committee of Senate recommending to Senate that the mandate of the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies be expanded to include the consideration of availability of resources, and that the Committee on Committees be instructed to provide revised Terms of Reference for the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies. <br><br></p> 
<p>This recommendation was made by the Executive Committee of Senate following consideration of a memorandum dated January 22, 1997, from the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies expressing concern that, while recognizing that the allocation of resources for new programmes is not within its mandate, the Committee has concerns with regard to the possible negative implications for existing programmes when resources that are already limited are allocated to new programmes. <br><br></p> 
<p>Dr. Treslan, Chair of the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies Committee, advised Senate that his Committee has discussed the recommendation of the Executive Committee of Senate and is against the proposal to amend the Terms of Reference of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, since it does not feel that it has sufficient knowledge to judge the adequacy of financial resources when considering new programmes or changes to existing programmes. Dr. Treslan stated that, while the Undergraduate Studies Committee is prepared to examine the academic aspect of such proposals, perhaps the question of financial resources should fall within the purview of the Committee on Academic Planning or the Advisory Committee on the Budget. He suggested that another possible solution would be to ask the heads of the academic units from which proposals originate to provide a detailed letter indicating that the financial resources have been considered. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following a lengthy discussion, it was moved by Dean Kealey, seconded by Dr. Bear and carried that the Committee on Committees be asked to examine the matter and to propose an appropriate mechanism for considering resource implications when new programmes or changes to existing programmes are being proposed. <br><br></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS FOR INFORMATION</span> <br><br></p> 
<p>67.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Executive Committee of Senate denied the following appeals</span> <br><br></p> 
<p>The Secretary of the Executive Committee reported that three student appeals (MUN NO.s 9561143, 9431057 and 8166084) were denied. Two undergraduate student appeals (MUN NO.s 9237250 and 9408089) were upheld.<br><br></p> 
<p>68.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ADJOURNMENT</span> <br><br></p>
