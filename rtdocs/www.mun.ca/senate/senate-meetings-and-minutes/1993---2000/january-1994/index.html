          "Professor and Head
          R.G. Sheath

          The degree of Master of Science is offered in Biology and Marine Biology to full-time and part-
          time students.  Students interested in animal behaviour should also consult the section in the
          Calendar describing the Master of Science in Biopsychology programme. In addition Master of
          Science degrees are offered in Aquaculture and Toxicology. See appropriate sections of this
          Calendar.

          Biology

          1.  The programme of a candidate shall be the responsibility of a Supervisory Committee composed
          of the Supervisor and at least two other appropriate members recommended to the Dean by the Head (or
          delegate) of the Department with the concurrence of the Supervisor.

          2.  The Supervisory Committee shall interview the student normally within a month of first
          registration, to discuss the student's programme and to explore any areas of weakness in the candidate's
          biological knowledge, especially where these relate to the intended areas of research.

          3.  A student will be required to take a minimum of two courses.

          4.  It is the function of a Supervisory Committee to have regular meetings, at least annually, with its
          graduate student.  A meeting report, signed by all members of the Supervisory Committee and student,
          must be given to the Department.  A copy will be sent to the graduate student and to the Dean of
          Graduate Studies.

          5.  The candidate will present a tentative outline of the proposed research to the Supervisory
          Committee, with a copy to the Department by the end of the second semester, and preferably prior to
          commencement of the research.

          6.  The student will present a research seminar to the Department, normally by the end of the second
          semester following admission, to describe the research topic being investigated and the
          methodologies to be employed.  This seminar provides  an opportunity for the student to receive
          constructive input from the broad biological
          community.

          7.  The candidate must present a thesis seminar of  30-40 minutes duration to the Department prior to
          submission of the thesis to the School of Graduate  Studies.  The candidate will be questioned by a
          panel approved by the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee, in consultation with the student's
          Supervisory Committee.  All others in attendance will be invited to question the candidate before
          adjournment.  Deficiencies noted at this stage should be carefully considered by the student and
          the Supervisory Committee prior to submission of the thesis for final examination.

          Under exceptional circumstances, this requirement may be waived by the Head of the Department (or
          delegate).

          8.  Each Master's candidate shall spend at least one semester in residence as a full-time student within
          the Department during the programme.  It is recommended that this semester be at the beginning
          of the programme.

          Under exceptional circumstances this requirement may  be waived by the Head of the Department (or
          delegate).

          9.  If candidates, in the opinion of the Supervisor, Committee and Department, are not making
          satisfactory progress, they will be required to  withdraw from the programme.

          10.  Theses shall conform to Regulation I. of the  General Regulations of the School of Graduate
          Studies and to the regulations in the Departmental Guidelines.

          Marine Biology

          1.  Admission to a Ph.D. programme in Biology shall not normally take place until after the completion
          of the course requirements and the submission of the thesis for the M.Sc. degree.  However, on the
          recommendation of the Department, this requirement may be waived by the Dean of Graduate Studies.

          2.  The programme of a candidate shall be the responsibility of a Supervisory Committee composed
          of the Supervisor and at least two other appropriate members recommended to the Dean by the Head (or

          candidate's biological knowledge, especially where these relate to the intended areas of research. The
          Supervisory Committee will recommend a student's subdiscipline within Biology to the Department in
         writing after this meeting.  

          4.  It is the function of a Supervisory Committee to have regular meetings, at least annually, with its
          graduate student.  A meeting report, signed by all members of the Supervisory Committee and student,
          must be given to the Department.  A copy will be sent to the graduate student and to the Dean of

          7.  When the Supervisory Committee deems it necessary, a working knowledge of a language other
          than English may be required.  

          8.  Comprehensive Examination

          a) Timing of Examination

          Timing of the comprehensive examination shall follow Regulation G.2.a. of the General Regulations
          governing the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.  A candidate registered in a full-time Ph.D. programme
          in the Faculty of Science, Department of Biology shall normally take the Comprehensive Examination
          during the first year of the programme, and no later than one year after completion of the prescribed
          courses. 


          The procedure shall be initiated by the candidate's Supervisor who will notify the Department of
          Biology, in writing, of the candidate's readiness. Failure to meet the above requirement can result in
          the candidate being required to withdraw from the programme.

          b) Examination Committee

          The Examination Committee shall be appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on the recommendation of
          the Department of Biology according to Regulation G.2.b. of the General Regulations of the School of
          Graduate Studies.  No more than 2 members of the examination committee may be members of the
          candidate's supervisory committee. The committee shall meet and recommend to the  Department in
          writing an examination seminar topic within the student's previously determined subdiscipline.

          c) Examination Procedure

          The Department shall provide the student the examination date and the seminar topic in writing
          not more than six nor less than four weeks prior to the examination. The student shall provide each
          member of the Examination Committee a written paper on the seminar topic one week prior to the
          examination. The Examination Committee shall evaluate the candidate's presentation and response
          to questions put to  him/her during the Oral Examination both on the seminar and within the
          student's subdiscipline of Biology.

          d) Subsequent Action

          The Examination Committee will meet in camera to arrive at its conclusions.  The Chair shall report
          the results of the Examination to the Head and to the Dean of Graduate Studies for transmission to the
          candidate.  The report will include one of the following decisions: a) the student passed or
          failed. b) if failed and it is the first examination  whether student may be re-examined.

          e) Re-examination

          Comprehensive Re-examination if permitted will occur not sooner than one month and not more than six
          months after the first.  The candidate and his or her Supervisory Committee shall be informed of the
          deficiencies found.  The format for the second examination will be determined by the Examination          
	  Committee with the approval of the Biology Graduate Studies Committee.  The candidate will be informed 
          of the topic and format four to six weeks prior to the examination. The examination will follow the
          procedure outlined in 8.c &amp; d (above). A failure will require the student to withdraw from the
          program.

          9.  Theses shall conform to Regulation I. of the General Regulations of the School of Graduate
          Studies and the Departmental Guidelines.
