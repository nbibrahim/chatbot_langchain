 </ul> 
</ul> 
<p><br><br></p> 
<ul> 
 <ul> 
  <li>This process should lead to the creation of a five or ten year flexible plan regarding the future of the University which should be formulated with all sectors of the University working in concert. This process will also require consultation with outside stakeholders.</li> 
 </ul> 
</ul> 
<p><br><br></p> 
<ul> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Briefing sessions should be held for the information of Senators regarding budgetary matters, planning processes, and the like.</li> 
 </ul> 
</ul> 
<p><br><br></p> 
<ul> 
 <ul>

<p>89. MINUTES <br><br></p> 
<p>The Minutes of the meeting held on April 14, 1998, were taken as read and confirmed. <br><br></p> 
<p>90. REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON SENATE <br><br></p> 
<p>It was agreed by separate motion where necessary, that the report of the Executive Committee be approved as follows: <br><br></p> 
<p>90.1 Final Report of the Senate ad hoc Committee on Procedures Concerning the Removal of Academic Administrators <br><br></p> 
<p>At a meeting held on November 18, 1997, Senate was advised that in a minute of November 6, the Board of Regents had requested "The President, after consultation within and without the University community, to recommend formal procedures for dismissal or other disciplinary measures with respect to academic administrators, including Vice-Presidents, Deans, and Directors". At that meeting, Senate was advised of the action the President would be taking in regard to the consultative process.</p> 
<p>Since the Board had already in this initiative provided for the prospect of a consultative Committee, Senate agreed to appoint an ad hoc Committee to made recommendations concerning the Removal of Academic Administrators. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was agreed to consider the final report of the Committee which was tabled at the April 14, 1998 meeting of Senate in order to allow sufficient time for a full discussion. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Dr. Adamec, seconded by Dr. Ghazala and carried that the Report be received with gratitude. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Dr. Adamec, seconded by Dr. Ghazala that Senate accept and so inform the Board of Regents, the procedures outlined in the report with respect to evaluation and review of Academic Administrators with one exception, that the mid-term reviews be conducted in all terms, i.e. that the dissenting report be accepted as well. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following considerable discussion, it was suggested by Dr. Kealey that the above motion be amended to accept the recommendations of the majority report. <br><br></p> 
<p>Since Dr. Adamec and Dr. Ghazala accepted this suggestion as a friendly amendment, a vote was taken on the main motion as amended and it was carried by a majority vote that Senate accept, and so inform the Board of Regents, the procedures outlined in the report with regard to evaluation and review of Academic Administrators. <br><br></p> 
<p>90.2. Report of the Senate ad hoc Committee on Outstanding Issues with Regard to the Proposed Computer Engineering Programme <br><br></p> 
<p>At a meeting held on February 10, 1998 Senate considered a proposal from the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science for a new Computer Engineering Programme to replace the existing Computer and Communication option currently offered in the Electrical Engineering Programme. The proposal was submitted to Senate by the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies which expressed its concern with regard to issues raised by the Department of Computer Science as stated in a letter dated January 9, from the Head of the Department. At the February 10 meeting of Senate a motion to approve the proposal was tabled until Senate determined whether the issues raised by the Department of Computer Science should be addressed prior to or on an on-going basis, following the approval and implementation of the proposed programme. It was then agreed that the issues with respect to the proposed Computer Engineering Programme be resolved before it is considered for approval by Senate and that an ad hoc Committee be appointed for the purpose of resolving these issues as expeditiously as possible in order that the Computer Engineering Programme might be considered no later than the May, 1998 meeting of Senate for offering in the 1998/99 academic year. <br><br></p> 
<p>The final report of the ad hoc Committee on Outstanding Issues with Regard to the Proposed Computer Engineering Programme has now been received, together with a Minority Report. Mr. George Beckett, Chair of the ad hoc Committee on Outstanding Issues with Regard to the Proposed Computer Engineering Programme, and several other Committee members were in attendance, at the invitation of Senate, to present the Report. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following Mr. Beckett's introduction, it was moved by Dr. Tulett, seconded by Dr. Adamec and carried that the Report of the ad hoc Committee be received with thanks. <br><br></p> 
<p>Senate then proceeded to discuss each of the following recommendations of the ad hoc Committee: <br><br></p> 
<p>"1<em>. A proposed Computer Engineering programme should go ahead as proposed by the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science</em>. The committee is satisfied that the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science can implement the Computer Engineering programme with or without the active cooperation of the Department of Computer Science. <br><br></p> 
<p>2. <em>The Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science and the Department of Computer Science should investigate cross-listing of courses identified as being common to both programmes.</em> If agreement cannot be reached about cross-listing then the originating academic unit has the option to go ahead with the course provided that it has the resources to adequately support the course. <br><br></p> 
<p>3. <em>A joint committee should be formed to coordinate computer related instruction throughout the university curriculum</em>. Computer education is not only an issue for Computer Science and the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. Representation on the committee should include Business, Continuing Education, Science (other than Computer Science), Arts, Engineering and Computer Science. It is essential that the university take a coordinated approach to curriculum development in support of information technology needs. The moribund Computer Science/Engineering Joint Committee on Academic Issues should be subsumed into this committee. <br><br></p> 
<p>4. <em>Senate should make explicit the principle that academic units have the right to create interdisciplinary programmes provided that they do not unduly duplicate the programmes of other academic units.</em> Some course overlap is to be expected with interdisciplinary programmes. Such overlap is acceptable provided that the overall programmes are not unduly duplicated. <br><br></p> 
<p>5. <em>It is suggested that the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science and the Department of Computer Science should use the letter dated April 20, 1998 from Dr. J. Quaicoe, Chair, Discipline of Electrical Engineering as a starting point for discussions about cross-listing of courses</em>. This letter recognizes the potential for significantly more cross-listing of courses than was identified in the original Computer Engineering proposal. <br><br></p> 
<p>6. <em>It is suggested that the Department of Computer Science should review its mechanisms for internal communication and consensus development</em>. Assistance in this review may be needed from the Dean of Science and/or other university resources. <br><br></p> 
<p>7. <em>It is suggested that the Department of Computer Science should seek external assistance in developing a strategic plan for its programmes in the near to mid-term future</em>. A clearer definition of the nature of the Computer Science programme, its objectives and place in the overall university curriculum would assist in resolving the serious concerns which are so evident amongst members of the department. The committee is convinced that Computer Science has equal (or potentially greater) opportunities than other units to benefit from the demand for information technology related education."</p> 
<p>It was moved by Dr. Sabin and seconded by Dr. Davidson to accept Recommendation 1. of the Report. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following considerable discussion, it was moved by Dr. Clark, seconded by Dr. Shorrocks and carried that the previous motion be tabled. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Dr. Vidyasankar, seconded by Mr. Corbett and carried that the author of the minority report be given the opportunity to speak. <br><br></p> 
<p>Dr. Middleton spoke to Senate regarding the concerns which he had raised in the Minority Report. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Professor Fowler and seconded by Acting Dean Davidson to accept recommendations 2. and 5. of the Report. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following a motion by Dr. Vidyasankar which was seconded by Mr. Corbett and carried, Dr. Ashoke Deb, Department of Computer Science, was permitted to address Senate regarding his concerns. <br><br></p> 
<p>Following a lengthy discussion, it was moved by Dr. Adamec, seconded by Dr. McKay and carried that recommendation 5. be amended to also include the Minority Report by Dr. Middleton as a starting point for discussions about cross-listing of courses. <br><br></p> 
<p>The motion to accept recommendation 2. and recommendation 5, as amended, was then carried. <br><br></p> 
<p>At this point, the Chairman left the meeting because of another commitment and Dr. Keough assumed the Chair. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Dr. Volk, seconded by Dean Murphy and carried that the following action be taken with regard to Recommendations 3, 4, 6 and 7: <br><br></p> 
<p>Recommendation 3. - Refer to the Vice-President (Academic) requesting that he report back to Senate with respect to the actions taken. <br><br></p> 
<p>Recommendation 4. - Refer to the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies for any further action which it deems necessary. <br><br></p> 
<p>Recommendation 6. - Refer to the Acting Dean of Science. <br><br></p> 
<p>Recommendation 7. - Refer to the Acting Dean of Science. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was then moved by Dr. Venkatesan, seconded by Dr. Adamec and carried that Dr. Gillard, Head, Department of Computer Science, be given the opportunity to speak to Senate. <br><br></p> 
<p>Dr. Gillard indicated his agreement with the action taken on the above recommendations. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Dr. Treslan, seconded by Dr. Seshadri and carried, that the motion to accept Recommendation 1. and to approve the programme in Computer Engineering as proposed be lifted from the table. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was then moved by Dr. Evans and seconded by Dr. Adamec that the proposed programme be modified in accordance with Recommendations 2. and 5. in an attempt to reduce course overlap. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was suggested that the effect of this proposed amendment would be to change the programme and courses without reference to the Faculty Councils of Science and Engineering and Applied Science as required by the University Act. A discussion ensued regarding whether the amendment was hostile to the original motion which had been proposed to accept Recommendation 1. <br><br></p> 
<p>Dr. Bear then moved to challenge the Chair's ruling and to entertain Evans/Adamec amendment. This motion was seconded by Dr. Adamec. The Chair then clarified that a ruling had not been made, rather Senate was engaged in a discussion as to whether the amendment was in order, and as a result the Bear/Adamec motion was not necessary. <br><br></p> 
<p>On a call for the question, a vote was taken on the amendment which failed. <br><br></p> 
<p>A vote was then taken on the motion of Sabin/Davidson to accept Recommendation 1.of the Report. The motion carried. <br><br></p>

<p>Insert the following section immediately before the heading Electrical Engineering: <br><br></p> 
<p>"<strong>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</strong> <br><br></p> 
<p>Computer Engineering is the design and analysis of computer systems applied to the solution of practical problems. It encompasses both hardware and software design in applications ranging from telecommunications and information systems to process control and avionics. Computer Engineering students learn the mathematics of discrete as well as continuous systems, the design of digital machines such as processors and memories, the fundamentals of software design, and the principles used in communications systems such as telephone networks and the Internet. Computer Engineering shares many fundamentals with Electrical Engineering, and these are covered in a common curriculum up to and including Term 4. Although students must decide to take Computer or Electrical Engineering prior to Term 3, they are not required to select between Computer and Electrical Engineering until the completion of Term 4. In Terms 5 and 6, students who have selected the Computer Engineering programme will take a core appropriate to the programme. In recognition of the considerable diversity of careers available to computer engineers, students are given latitude in the final three terms to choose from a wide range of electives in various speciality areas. Electives can be tailored to meet the needs of those who plan to go straight into industry as well as those who wish to join the increasing number of our graduates who are pursuing advanced degrees." <br><br></p>

<p>MUN NO. 7663263 - Appeal for Readmission <br><br></p> 
<p>Mrs. M. O'Dea, Deputy Registrar, was in attendance, by invitation, to present this student case since Mr. Collins had indicated that his previous involvement with this student could place him in a perceived conflict of interest position. <br><br></p> 
<p>At a meeting held on April 30, 1998, the Executive Committee of Senate considered an appeal from the above-noted student, submitted on his behalf by his lawyer, Mr. Brian Casey. <br><br></p> 
<p>In a memorandum dated 1 May 1998, the Executive Committee agreed to recommend to Senate that an ad hoc Committee of Senate be struck to consider this case and to report back to Senate with recommendations regarding the disposition of the students's appeal for re-admission. The Executive Committee asked the Committee on Committees to make recommendations at this meeting for membership and Terms of Reference for the ad hoc Committee if Senate is in agreement with this recommendation. <br><br></p> 
<p>It was moved by Mrs. O'Dea, seconded by Dean Kealey and carried that the recommendation to appoint an ad hoc Committee to review the appeal of MUN No. 7663262 be accepted. <br><br></p> 
<p>A memorandum dated May 3, 1998 was received from the Committee on Committees submitting proposed terms of reference and membership for the ad hoc Committee as follows: <br><br></p> 
<p>1. To examine all documents presented to the Senate with regard to this case <br><br></p> 
<p>To interview Mr. Brian Casey, Dr. M.C. Nurse and any other parties it deems necessary. <br><br></p> 
<p>3. To conduct further investigations as the committee deems necessary. <br><br></p> 
<p>To make recommendations to Senate in a timely fashion with regard to the appellant's application for readmission to the University. <br><br></p> 
<p>If a recommendation is made that the appellant be readmitted to the University and that recommendation is accepted by Senate, but the appellant is subsequently denied re-admission to the Faculty of Education by that Faculty, the ad hoc Committee is to be re-convened to consider and make recommendations to Senate with regard to the disposi tion of the appellant's application for re-admission to the Faculty of Education. <br><br></p> 
<p><strong>Membership:</strong> <br><br></p>

<p>"BACHELOR OF ARTS WITH CERTIFICATE IN HERITAGE RESOURCES <br><br></p> 
<p>Programme Coordinator: Dr. G. Pocius, Department of Folklore <br><br></p> 
<p>The certificate programme in Heritage Resources is offered to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts with Certificate degree programme and to students who wish to upgrade a general B.A. to a B.A. with Certificate. Building on the student's academic grounding in anthropology/archaeology, folklore, history, geography, and other relevant disciplines, the programme offers training in object documentation, identification, conservation, and display. Required courses give students both an awareness of the broad range of heritage resources--including objects, sites, landscapes, documents--and specific skills to deal with public perceptions of objects and artifacts. The programme also includes a course in tourism management. Elective courses enable students to pursue their particular disciplinary interests. <br><br></p> 
<p>The B.A. with Certificate in Heritage Resources helps prepare students to work in the expanding heritage sector in Newfoundland or elsewhere. Students with this degree will be better able to compete for positions in museums and historic sites and for employment with heritage consultants and to participate in contracts involving heritage policy and planning--all part of the increasing regional and global importance of cultural tourism. The B.A. with Certificate in Heritage Resources will also be an advantage to students wishing to study heritage or cultural resources management at the graduate level. <br><br></p> 
<p>The certificate programme in Heritage Resources draws on the expertise of the Archaeology Unit, the Centre for Material Culture Studies, and individual faculty members in various departments and faculties. <br><br></p> 
<p><strong>ADMISSION</strong> <br><br></p> 
<p>Enrolment in the Certificate in Heritage Resources is limited and competitive. Students are advised to notify the Programme Coordinator in their first year if they intend to apply for this Certificate. Formal application is normally made in the second semester of the second year through the Office of the Registrar. <br><br></p>
