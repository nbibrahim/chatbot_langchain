<p>Last month, President Timmons recognized longtime lab instructor Ed Whelan with the <em>President’s Award for Outstanding Teaching</em> in the Lecturers and Instructional Staff category. Dr. Yolanda Wiersma was motivated to spearhead the nomination after working closely with Ed, and the team of first-year instructors in the early days of the pandemic to implement quantitative training in our first year courses. Dr. Hurford, who has been leading the effort to increase quantitative training across the curriculum supported the nomination, saying “Ed Whalen’s contributions to the launch of our quantitative training program in BIOL 1001 go beyond the traditional view of what it is to be an exceptional teacher: this contribution will open a world of opportunities for our students…”</p>

<span class="t4-page-title">Newfoundland and Labrador&rsquo;s Carnivorous Symbol</span>
<p>Every province has a floral symbol that represents something about their province or territory. Newfoundland and Labrador is unique compared to all others in its choice of a provincial symbol. While Alberta chose a Wild Rose and Saskatchewan chose the Western Red Lily, Newfoundland appointed a carnivorous plant; the Pitcher Plant.</p>
<p>The Newfoundland Pitcher plant, named for its pitcher-like shaped leaves at the base of its stem, lures in insects by using its brightly coloured red veins as a means of attraction. The lips of the leaves have hairs that face downwards, making it easy for the insect to crawl towards the pool formed at the base of the leaves, but harder for them to crawl out. After a certain point, the hairs stop, and the leaf’s waxy surface causes the organisms to fall into the deadly pool contained within. This mechanism of feeding makes them quite unique as a floral emblem.</p>

<span class="t4-page-title">Oceans as a Lab</span>
<p>Off the shores of the Bonne Bay Marine Station, you can find Dr. Suzanne Dufour standing on a boat with a device called a grab sampler that’s diving into the depths of the ocean below. Dr. Dufour then takes these prized samples back to her lab where she analyzes them to study the beneficial interactions between bacteria and organisms. If you are baffled as to what organisms someone could find in a pile of mud, and how you would go about studying them along with something as tiny as bacteria, you would not be the only one.</p>
