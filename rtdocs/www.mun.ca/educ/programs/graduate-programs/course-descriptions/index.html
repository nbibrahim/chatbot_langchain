<p><strong><a id="6100"></a>ED 6100 - Research Designs and Methods in Education</strong></p>
<p>Education 6100 is an introductory course in research designs and methods. It is intended to cover the broad spectrum of research methods found in published research in education. The course has two main goals: to help students make sense of the research they can be expected to encounter in their graduate program and their professional practice, and to provide the basis for more intensive study in particular research methods required in the conduct of their own research.&nbsp;(3 credit hours)</p>

In particular, the course provides ways of analyzing and understanding differences which challenge monocultural and discriminatory assumptions. Also explored are the ways in which such insights provide direction for the development of culturally responsive and sensitive policy, reflective and anti-discriminatory teaching, more inclusive and responsive curriculum, and more equitable practices on a wide range of educational sites.&nbsp;(3 credit hours)</p>

The informing questions of the course are: How, and in what ways, are media, technologies and culture pedagogical? and, What do educators need to know about media, technologies and culture in order to be (more) effective pedagogically? This course is designed as an introduction to these issues.&nbsp;(3 credit hours)</p>

<p>Is argumentation and decision-making on matters of educational policy and practice simply based on personal preferences, or social consensus or political power relations between educational stakeholders? To what extent are the results of science and public opinion of value in making justified decisions? Are there rationally defensible and objective principles, values and criteria necessary for reasoned moral deliberation and effective policy design? This course focuses on skills of argumentation and decision-making required by educational leaders for the formulation of ethically justifiable educational policy and the cogent assessment of educational practice. The bases or grounds of skilled educational leadership will be examined through the study of a number of issues, case-studies and debates in the areas of educational leadership, policy studies and administrative ethics. Both classical and modern texts will be will be studied. Questions regarding the rationality and rightness of practical and moral decision-making will be pursued through such topics as educational opportunity and equality, the priority of intellectual autonomy as an educational ideal, the character of democratic public deliberation, and educational authority. These topics will illustrate fundamental differences between technical and humanistic conceptions of educational deliberation and argumentation.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="6461"></a>ED 6461 - Graduate Research Writing</strong></p>
<p>In this course, we focus on research writing in particular. You will learn how to deconstruct academic writing genres such as research conceptualization, literature reviews, writing the methodology, research proposals, thesis writing, constructing arguments and how to avoid plagiarising. In addition, the course covers writing processes, techniques and strategies that will aid a procrastination-free and productive approach to writing. Finally, you will reflect on yourself as a writer as part of the process of cultivating an identity as a scholarly writer. This course links theory and practice, and provides graduate students with a range of practical techniques and strategies. Since this is a credit-bearing course, three assignments need to be completed. The first is an assessment of your own writing history and practices; the second is an analysis of writing in your discipline; and the third is a portfolio assignment of examples of your own writing where you apply what you learn in the course. Every week, you will be given writing tasks and strategies to practice. You can use whatever writing you are currently working on to practice these techniques. In the past, participants have used their thesis proposals, chapters, papers for publication, abstracts, grant proposals, course assignments, etc. The portfolio assignment is made up of extracts of this writing and there is a strong emphasis throughout the course on your own writing needs.

<p>Relationships First: Rethinking Educational Engagement examines the fundamental principles and practices of relational restorative justice approaches in the context of current education theory and philosophy. Content focuses on an examination of educational engagement as understood through the lens of relational theory. Particularly suited to the complexities of the day, this course is an exploration and analysis of current relational, restorative justice education theories and practices in school contexts locally, nationally and internationally. As a comprehensive alternative to dominant schooling, relational engagement offers significant potential for renewed perspectives on safe and care school policies, inclusion policies and classroom dynamics as well as for curriculum content and design, pedagogy, and assessment.</p>
<p>Drawing on ancient and contemporary indigenous and spiritual traditions, it also explores the recommendations in the recent Truth and Reconciliation Report (2016). As students examine both the promises and challenges associated with educational engagement through relational restorative justice education, they will also experience and practice its various pedagogies in assignments and class activities.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="6467"></a>ED 6467 - Quantitative Research Methods</strong></p>
<p>Over the past four decades research methods in the socio-behavioural sciences have tended to become bifurcated into qualitative methods on the one hand and quantitative&nbsp; methods on the other. Most researchers have had some experience with both procedures, but usually emphasize one of the two research orientations. Those working in the quantitative tradition are more likely to treat educational research as a natural science than those working in the qualitative tradition. As such, they aim at causal explanations by way or theories, hypothesis generation and testing.</p>
<p>In keeping with this tradition, students taking Education 6467 will be introduced to such research procedures as: measurement and measurement modelling, validity and reliability, research design, falsification, experimental and quasi-experimental methods, survey research methods, and sampling.

Topics will include: definitions of the two concepts; an examination of the six basic positions with regard to the relationship between the two concepts; and , the state of current research as to their role in learning of an L2. Students will be encouraged to adopt one of the six positions with regard to the relationship between these concepts in the teaching of an L2, and to defend their decision. The question of how an understanding of the role of each concept and the relationship between them can lead to the development of strategies that will contribute to more effective teaching will also be examined.
