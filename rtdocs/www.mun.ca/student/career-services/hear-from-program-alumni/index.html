<p>The Career Development Office has had a stream of exceptional students grace our halls over the years. Whether it was directly through our unit or through the multitude of other departments and units we support through our on-campus employment funding programs, these students have positively shaped the work we do here and have gone on to do many a wonderful thing in their own careers, takling with them the learnings from our programs. We're honoured to be able to feature some of those stories of the students and alumni who will forever share a special bond with us!</p>

<p>Fall 2016 with the Systems Unit within the Registrar's Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>Having a job on-campus helped me connect with the university community and become aware of many of the resources and opportunities available to students- it&nbsp;made me feel like more than just a body count in a sea of others. That last year of my studies was the highlight of my student experience&nbsp; and my only regret is not having applied&nbsp;for on-campus employment earlier on my studies.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>The systems unit I worked in is responsible for handling registrations for all Memorial students. In that capacity, I became well-versed in the functions of a Registrar's Office, made lifelong friends and met some of the best co-workers.&nbsp; This is where I&nbsp;discovered my passion for post-secondary studies and received the push I needed to&nbsp;want to pursue&nbsp;a Master’s Degree, which I am currently working on along with being employed in the Registrar's Office. My goal is to apply to the PhD in Education program to continue doing research that will hopefully make a positive impact in the university landscape. My professional goal is to make all students feel welcome and heard, and let them know that they are not just&nbsp;statistics and are highly valued on their own merit as&nbsp;a member of the university.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>Apply for all and any on-campus employment opportunities- you never know where they will take you; you could make friends for life or you can find your passion (as I have). If you need&nbsp;any guidance or have questions, reach out to the Career Development Office- they are always here to help.&nbsp;My current life moto is:&nbsp; Make it happen, sock everyone!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creative sabbatical after a highly successful tenure as Research Manager for two pan-Canadian scientific networks at McMaster University and the University of British Columbia between 2001 - 2021</p>
<p><strong>MUCEP&nbsp;placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple placements between&nbsp;1997 - 2000 with then Education Services and Departments of English, Sociology and Philosophy</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>My MUCEP placements were opportunities to change gears for a few hours per day / week, where I could focus on something outside of my busy school and study schedule, while at the same time I was learning and gaining valuable skills.&nbsp;I was very fortunate to hold MUCEP placements as an editing assistant for outstanding MUN academics. I edited research materials for Dr. Elizabeth Miller, a world-renowned&nbsp;<em>Dracula</em>&nbsp;scholar; and for Dr. John A. Scott, I assisted in the editing of a comprehensive manuscript that detailed the history of labour unionism in Newfoundland. I also held three administrative placements and my supervisors and colleagues were consummate professionals who communicated effectively and contributed to high-functioning team environments, and I reflected on these experiences often as I developed my career in human resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Scott kindly provided me with a reference, which helped me to secure a full-time position in the summer of 1998 with a not-for-profit community-based organization. The people at that organization made me feel like a valued member of their team and encouraged me to continue to build on my administrative skills.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>MUCEP placements provide opportunities to learn from professionals, where successful candidates can “try on” careers with short-term commitments. These placements can also grow one’s network, enhance one’s resume with professional experiences, and provide additional income that always comes in handy.</p>

<p>Multiple positions between&nbsp;1997 - 2002 at then Centre for Career Development, Student Development, Glenn Roy Blundon Centre</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>It 100% improved my university experience by introducing me to a group of individuals that helped guide me to be the professional I am today. I learned so much about career development and the contacts that I developed, and the opportunities it provided, helped me build confidence, increase my awareness of work responsibilities, identify how to interact in a professional workplace and created a professional network that I carried with me throughout my career. It definitely strengthened my university experience and my joy of learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>It taught me very important skills such as successful job search strategies, resume writing, and interview practices.

<p>Bachelor of Arts (2022)</p>
<p><strong>Current status:</strong></p>
<p>Employed full-time</p>
<p><strong>Current employment role(s):</strong></p>
<p>Applications&nbsp;Officer, School of Graduate Studies, Memorial University of Newfoundland</p>
<p><strong>MUCEP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple positions between 2017 - 2019 with the Systems Unit within the Registrar's Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>When I originally started at Memorial, I didn’t think I would be able to manage full time studies, a part time job (outside of the university) and a MUCEP position, however I was very wrong. The MUCEP position worked around my hectic schedule to ensure that I would meet my required hours for each semester. Because of this, I worked while I was on campus in between my classes and was still able to focus on my studies. This was my first non-retail related job and it lead me to develop my skills to deal with situations in the most professional way possible, which included how to appropriately respond to student enquiries about all things related to registrations over the phone, email and in person. It was a very rewarding experience being able to provide the appropriate help to students.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>My MUCEP position offered me more opportunities within the university. In the summer of 2021, I was able to get a job with Enrolment Services – which gave me a different perspective of the Registrar’s Office, which ended up turning into a temporary full-time position with potential for extension. Once I was in this temporary position, I was able to view job postings for internal staff, which ultimately lead my to gaining experience with job interviews – which we all know can be very nerve wracking – and allowed me to focus on what my strengths and weaknesses are in a professional setting. With the experience gained from just interviews, I was able to work on my confidence and ended up getting a position as Applications Officer with the School of Graduate Studies. I believe that if it weren’t for me being able to get my foot in the door through my MUCEP position in the Registrar’s Office, I likely wouldn’t have been able to start this path that I am now on within the University. MUCEP gave me the experience of working in a professional setting and set me up for a future at Memorial.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>My number one piece of advice is to try out an on-campus employment position for at least one semester of your degree. You never know where it will lead you. Even if you choose not to continue on with it in the future, you still gain the experience of working in an environment that isn’t retail and gives you a sense of what life might be like after finishing your degree.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A big thank you to Melissa Mallard, Lynn Rogers, Sharon Peach, Tish Walsh and Nancy Wood for always being there to lend a helping hand and answering my constant questions as I navigated this new territory. When a lot of information is being thrown at you, and you need to try and remember all the little details for courses, (like restrictions, holds, dates, etc.) it can get confusing, so if it weren’t for these ladies, I don’t know what I would have done. They certainly made my MUCEP experience a little more special.</p>

<p><strong>SWASP&nbsp;placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>2007 SWASP as an archival consultant for Battle Harbour Historic Trust</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>I was able to work not far from home and felt supported financially, which made it manageable for me to balance work and writing my dissertation. This would otherwise have been more difficult if I had to have spent the summer in Battle Harbour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my placement, I catalogued, based on condition of use and relevance to the organization's operations, several documents for the Trust. I also assessed,&nbsp;with help from local conservators in St. John’s, several material artifacts belonging to the Trust. I had weekly contact with Gail Pearcey, then volunteer business director of the Trust, on the work I was completing. With the encouragement of Battle Harbour Historic Trust Chair, Gordon Slade, Ms. Pearcey suggested I take part in a fascinating, local conference around the preservation and conservation of historic churches in Newfoundland and Labrador so that I might gain insight on material artifacts and/or textual documents corresponding to the church located at Battle Harbour. All of this together made for a very rich student life experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you&nbsp;think your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>It allowed me to focus my attention on a few strengths I have that have continued into my academic career as a lecturer and writer: I am always curious, always interested in learning something new, and I am always keen to research and write about that research. Furthermore, I still use the work experience I gained from that SWASP opportunity in the courses that I teach through the Dept of Folklore and the Dept of Sociology. Bringing my work experiences into the classroom allows me to encourage students to consider archival, museum, and/or other intangible cultural heritage opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>Students should take advantage of these on-campus employment opportunities whenever possible. They are rewarding on several levels not least of which is how they engage your senses, hone your skills, and provide stimulating learning experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?</strong></p>
<p>Many, many thanks to Gail Pearcey, former volunteer business director of Battle Harbour Historic Trust.</p>

<p><strong>Current employment role(s):</strong></p>
<p>Student Research Assistant with the Cannabis Health Evaluation and Research Partnership (CHERP) team at the School of Pharmacy and Faculty of Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>MUCEP&nbsp;placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple placements with the Faculty of Science between 2020 - 2021</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>During my 3<sup>rd</sup> year of undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work in Dr. Carole Peterson’s lab on children’s earliest memories. I assisted with a project investigating children’s recall of early memories by modifying interviewing techniques. The findings hope to provide support to children in both forensic and clinical situations. As a research assistant, I was responsible for recruiting participants aged 6 to 12 years, conducting qualitative interviews with 20 children, transcribing interviews, and contacting parents to verify the memories their children provided. Through this experience, I acquired interviewing skills using open-ended recall, which has been shown to be the most accurate as well as least susceptible to interviewer suggestion or influence.</p>
<p>My work with Dr. Peterson and my experience conducting interviews provided me with valuable experience that led me to my next research assistant position with the Cannabis Health Evaluation and Research Partnership (CHERP) team with the School of Pharmacy and Faculty of Medicine. Under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Bishop and Dr. Jennifer Donnan, I completed a research project titled “Cannabis Legalization: Impact on Youth and Young Adults in NL”, where I conducted focus groups (FG) exploring youth (13-18) and young adults’ (19-25) opinions and perceptions on a variety of topics concerning cannabis legalization.</p>
<p>I continued working with the CHERP team during my final year of undergraduate studies as I completed fall and winter MUCEP positions. The MUCEP positions gave me the opportunity to stay engaged in research as I completed my final courses. I gained valuable research experience, I connected with professors and mentors, and these experiences opened so many opportunities which are helping me reach my future goals.</p>
<p>Following these MUCEP positions, I was awarded&nbsp;my second SURA which I completed with the CHERP team. This summer I had the opportunity to continue working on research that I am extremely passionate about and stay engaged in this ongoing project.</p>
<p>Having on-campus employment during my studies was an amazing opportunity as I was getting the chance to apply what I was learning in my courses to the real world. A psychology degree focusses a lot on research; therefore, getting first-hand experience and getting to apply my knowledge&nbsp;was extremely beneficial and I believe had a positive impact on my grades.</p>
<p>Also, my MUCEP positions were extremely flexible. My supervisors ensured that I was prioritizing course work and supported me throughout the year. I did not find it challenging to have a full course load and employment. As long as you are managing your time effectively, you will have a lot of success!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>I think my MUCEP placements have had a huge impact on my career paths or prospects. Prior to my first placement, I was extremely indecisive and not sure what the future had in store. However, gaining firsthand research experience really solidified my love for research and how it is most definitely something I want to continue.</p>
<p>Also, I have always been extremely passionate about helping youth and about substance use disorders. My placements with CHERP gave me the opportunity to research cannabis use and work closely youth from across the province to identify effective modalities to improve their substance use health literacy. I believe teaching youth and young adults about substances through a harm reduction approach is crucial. My MUCEP placements and SURA placements with CHERP is giving me the opportunity to conduct research on harm reduction and to make a significant impact on youth in our province.</p>
<p>These MUCEPs led me to focusing my Masters in that area. My masters project is a sub-part of the DECYDE project that is focused on designing and evaluating a cannabis education strategy for school-age youth. The objective of my project is to address what tools are available to measure harm reduction programs for youth and what we know about their intended use, scope and theoretical foundation. Through a patient engagement approach, my project aims to conduct a scoping review to inform the development of a tool for grades 4-6 and develop and validate a cannabis health literacy tool to evaluate the pilot of the grades 4-6 curriculum.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a registered child clinical psychologist with a focus on substance use disorders and childhood trauma. These experiences are helping me to reach that goal. I am getting the chance to work with youth, conduct research in my area of interest and see the research process throughout.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>To current and future students, I think it is extremely beneficial to gain work experience throughout your undergraduate degree. These opportunities give you clarity on what you may or may not be interested in doing in the future. You get the opportunity to network and collaborate with others. You learn new skills that can be applicable to your future career. You get to apply skills that you are learning throughout your degree in real world situations which overall improves your competence.&nbsp;Keep your mind open because any opportunity you take can open a door to future opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>MUCEP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Communications Assistant with Memorial University of Newfoundland Students' Union (MUNSU)</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>My role with MUNSU began in summer 2020 where I worked closely with the executive director of external affairs, communication, and research, to communicate with 11,000 undergraduate students through media engagements and developed my knowledge in website development, social media management, and marketing strategies. When MUNSU held their yearly elections in March of 2021, I decided to harness my familairity witht he organization through my MUCEP&nbsp;experience and&nbsp;compete for that directorial role.&nbsp; I was appointed to the position and thus, represented undergraduate students throughout the last year of my program.&nbsp;What started as a MUCEP job for me blossomed into being able to identify myself as one of five student leaders that ran the organization throughout the 2021-2022 academic term. Being involved in this capacity transformed my student experience and allowed me to connect with thousands of post-secondary students in Newfoundland and Labrador. It gave me the chance to deepen my knowledge of organizational structure and community leadership. I cannot imagine what my undergraduate student experience would have been like if I did not step out of my comfort zone in my second year of university by applying for the communications assistant position. By obtaining this job, I was able to narrow down and pursue my passions as a student including advocacy, policy development, enhancing communications, and building public relations. As a result of this experience, I am now doing this type of work with an independent agency of the provincial government.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>When graduating with a BSW, I had no idea I would be working in a field directly related to human rights, communications and public engagement. However, as a result of completing MUCEP hours and engaging in student life at Memorial, my experience was broadened and so were my job prospects. Working on campus and contributing to the Memorial community also provided me with both social and financial support. As a result of supporting students and being involved in leadership roles, I was able to develop lasting friendships and apply for scholarships that gave me the opportunity to obtain funding and further my education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>One positive thing about working for the university is that they understand the challenges and responsibilities that are associated with being a student. Therefore, they&nbsp;are typically&nbsp;accommodating towards your academic commitments. I encourage students to get involved in university life whenever possible. One MUCEP position could transform your professional journey, as it did mine.</p>

<p><strong>MUCEP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple positions with then Centre for Career Development until 1997</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>When I first went to MUN, I thought I was going to be a social worker. I went to the Student Volunteer Bureau (SVB) and found an opportunity to volunteer off-campus to gain experience…I lasted 3 months.&nbsp; I went back to the SVB to look for another opportunity when I changed my academics to prepare to apply to nursing – and started volunteering at the Health Science Centre, where I lasted 3 weeks, which made me doubt my nursing plans. After two program changes in two years, I decided to take the courses that I enjoyed which led me to my BA. At that time, I started to look for opportunities that I enjoyed. I started volunteering&nbsp;more and went to the&nbsp;Career Development&nbsp;Centre (then called the Employment Centre) to look for a part-time, on-campus job, which led me to working at the Centre.&nbsp;I instantly felt a connection to the work that everyone was doing there and everything seemed to be a fit.&nbsp;MUN truly was my home away from home.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>It helped me get the experience I needed to start my career. After graduation, I found myself wondering what to do next. Thankfully my experience at the career centre landed me&nbsp;a position in a non-profit employment resource centre. I was thankful to be working but something still didn’t seem to fit.&nbsp; After some soul searching, I realized that it was the combination of the work I was doing&nbsp;in Career Development and the post-secondary environment that was the total package for me. I have been working in post-secondary since 2001 and found what I love. My role now involves mentoring post-secondary students as they discover their passions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>I encourage all students to get involved on campus and more specifically, work on campus.&nbsp; It provides great learning experiences with just the right number of hours to not jeopardize your academics, along with the flexibility and support that post-secondary students need.&nbsp; My son is currently attending Memorial and I would love for him to work on campus this academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?</strong></p>
<p>Rob Shea was the Manager of the Employment Centre when I was there.&nbsp; He continued to be an important role model during my career, encouraging me to present at conferences and apply and complete my Master of Education at Memorial.&nbsp; I am always happy to see his name on a speaker list when attending conferences in Ontario.</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>Having an on-campus job really enhanced my student experience by allowing me to make valuable connections with people while learning new skills that I still use long after I have graduated. For instance, semesters working as a Digitization Assistant have given me valuable digitization skills that I have used in digitizing photos for the Marine Institute Archive. Furthermore, working at Archives and Special Collections allowed me to become very familiar with the library system and shelving books which is very useful in my job as a Library Technician. Finally, working different MUCEP jobs in various archives and libraries on campus has allowed me to be familiar with different collections which is helpful when I am helping researchers at the Marine Institute and at the Rooms. I would highly recommend every student working a MUCEP if they can. The flexibility of working around my class schedule was great; and it allowed me to not have to worry as much about money, and to really focus on my studies.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>I believe my MUCEP jobs did impact my career path because I have always loved research and education, and being able to get a taste of working in those fields allowed me to recognize what I enjoyed. Luckily, I now get to combine those two things in my career!</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>My advice would be to take advantage of all the opportunities you have available to you because you never know how handy that work experience is until you are graduated and working!</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?</strong></p>
<p>Before I finished my last MUCEP at the Maritime History Archive, they gave me a cake that said, “Good Luck Jessie!” and I thought that was so kind and thoughtful. I really enjoyed my experience there and am still in contact with everyone today!</p>

<p><strong>MUCEP and SWASP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple placements between 1996 - 1999 with the School of Social Work (MUCEP), and MacMorran Community Centre (SWASP).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>The experience was overall very positive. It allowed me to help pay for my studies and expedite the payment of my student loans. I learned a great deal working as a research assistant which contributed to my research, writing, and typing skills, to benefit my coursework. Up to that point I had not learned to type quickly, but transcribing twenty-two&nbsp; hours of audio-recorded interviews led to improved keyboarding skills that have benefited me immensely in both my academic and professional careers. I had been volunteering at MacMorran community centre with various youth programs since 1996 and the SWASP program provided the non-profit community centre assistance in staffing their summer program and also provided me with more experience working with children. This experience helped me to choose a career focus, as I learned that really enjoyed working with children.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>Both programs had a positive impact on my eventual career path and prospects. The experience I received through the SWASP program helped me to recognize my passion for working with children and youth. This led me into the fields of counselling and education. It also provided me with valuable experience that enhanced my applications to the Master of Education program in Counselling Psychology and the Bachelor of Education program. The experience I gained as a MUCEP student provided me with critical skills that supported my success in all of my academic and professional pursuits thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>These services are there for you as part of your student experience and are paid for in part by your student fees. I urge you to take advantage of these wonderful resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow your heart and make use of your natural strengths and your interests. People spend a great portion of their lives at work, so spend them well by working at something that ignites a passion within you. I won’t say that if you work at something you love you will never work a day in your life, because that is not accurate; however, you will feel fulfilled and have the desire to keep working through the hard days when you are committed to and care about the field in which you work.</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a job on campus was a wonderful experience. It allowed me to meet staff at Memorial and learn about the university’s operations. An on-campus position also allowed me great flexibility in terms of balancing work and school since I was able to complete my work during breaks in my class schedule.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My experience provided me an opportunity to work with students, conduct research, get familiar with the Banner information system and to complete transfer credit evaluations. The position gave me an early understanding of university operations, allowed me to become comfortable working in a professional office environment and introduced me to transfer credit opportunities, which I later completed during my graduate studies.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would encourage students to take advantage of career opportunities through the career development office. It is a wonderful way to get practical work experience in an environment that is comfortable and convenient for students. You can also network during your positions which can help set you up for further opportunities and when those opportunities come along, because they will, definitely say yes!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>It helped me to gain some very valuable practical experience that I could take into later positions.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>I spent a summer doing specimen preparations and data collection for an ecology lab that was studying meadow voles in Labrador. I also spent a summer in a cytology lab doing histochemical and enzyme cytochemical staining of plant and mammal tissues. Another project I was involved in was looking at environmental contaminants and effects on growth and reproduction of fish. I spent some time at the OSC and it was there that I learned how to do flame ionization detection thin layer chromatography (TLC) of lipids in the liver. After completing several of these summer placements, I successfully obtained a two-year post-graduate scholarship from NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council) that allowed me to complete an MSc in Biological Sciences (Immunology and Parasitology) from the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>This combination of advanced education, coupled with technical skills gained through my earlier on-campus employment experiences at Memorial, led to my first longer term positions working in research assistant positions in cancer and neuroscience laboratories at Dalhousie University and Memorial University.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>Take advantage of these on-campus work opportunities - they can offer so much more than a “summer job”. These experiences can help develop transferable skills, grow your confidence, meet possible future mentors, and make friends with students who are in the same program of study.&nbsp;Many small stepping stones can build an entire career!</p>

<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>Throughout my work placements, I realized my passion for computer science, which lead to me getting a minor in the subject. I also learnt that I enjoy fast-paced, university-type work environments and will be pursuing a career in similar settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>I would encourage people to reach out to their potential employers before the MUCEP portal opens. It&nbsp;often boosts your chances of getting a job if you are applying as a familiar face.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>I had a lot of freedom to pursue creative means in promoting the services through different marketing techniques, which was fantastic to experience. My supervisors were also very helpful in guiding me with work plans through emails and/or meetings, as needed. My position was not in-person due to it being over the pandemic lockdown. However, having an on-campus employment with supervisors who work in academia made it easy to manage my time&nbsp;since they had had a greater understanding/appreciation of my class schedule. It was nice to know that if I had an exam that week, my employers would understand if less work was completed that week, as long as I had a plan to ensure all projects were completed by their due date.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>I believe being able to work with counselling and psychological services added to my resume and credibility for future employers, especially considering my goal to someday work in psychiatric nursing.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>If there is a MUCEP position available, especially in your program, apply! Even if it is outside of your program, it may help you find new interests while teaching you how to enhance your transferable skills.</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>Having an on-campus job forced me to manage my time better and make contacts outside of my immediate residence circle. I would say it was one of the most valuable experiences of my university career. I loved my time at Answers. The fulltime staff were wonderful, the culture was great and I really got some valuable work experience, in addition to building my resume. I knew I was interested in education, but I didn't&nbsp;want to be a teacher.&nbsp; Being only aware of traditional careers, this opened my eyes up to so many more career opportunities in education and gave me valuable experience and contacts that I needed.&nbsp; I am still in touch with former full-time staff and fellow&nbsp;MUCEPs from that time. Now, I always advise students to look for on-campus valuable work or volunteer experience- it really is important to develop your soft skills, your resume and your contacts.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>Without these jobs, I wouldn’t have been exposed to a career in post-secondary education.&nbsp; Also, being in a program without co-op, I wouldn't have had the career experience and references needed to make me competitive for my first jobs out of university.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>Your tuition covers such an amazing range of services, use them. I always tell students that studies are important, but when you graduate, all of your classmates have the same degree. How do you stand out from the pack when applying for jobs? Career Services at MUN can help you build a great resume, practice interview skills, help you build student work and volunteer experience, set you up with networking events, etc.&nbsp; It is so valuable,take advantage of them!</p>

<p>Research Assistant, Memorial University of Newfoundland</p>
<p><strong>MUCEP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple positions with the Department of Archaeology between 2017 - 2021</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>During my initial MUCEP I lived on-campus in Paton College, and the job being also located on-campus was very convenient. Both MUCEP positions allowed me more flexibility with my course schedule than I previously had at other part-time positions off-campus. I believe coming into campus for work also increased my familiarity and comfort with the laboratory group and department members prior to applying to my Honours or Masters programs.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I wanted to mention:&nbsp;The MAAS laboratory supports a host of work from bioarchaeology, zooarchaeology, to sclerochronology. Dr. Burchell and I share an interest in shellfish research and human-environmental interactions. When I came to her laboratory as an assistant in 2017, I was responsible for sorting clams, and cleaning them prior to analysis by her other students.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>The practical experience I earned through being able to work in a laboratory as an undergraduate student opened many doors for me. Following my position processing and cataloguing materials for the MAAS lab during one of my MUCEPs, I was selected for the Federal Student Work Program during the summer of 2019. My experience allowed me to work as an Archaeological Field Technician for Parks Canada, traveling to archaeological sites across Atlantic Canada. This included survey work in the Torngat Mountains, which was a once in a lifetime research opportunity in an Arctic environment. The technical skills I had built through MUCEP allowed me to assist with the processing and cataloguing artifacts in the Park’s Canada collections. <br> <br> The doors opened by my MUCEP position allowed me to continue on to an honour’s degree and now a Master’s in the field of Archaeology. I was able to build skills as an undergraduate that served as a foundation for the technical work in the MAAS lab, where I am currently fulfilling the requirements of a Masters.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>It can be daunting as an undergraduate student in the Humanities and Social Sciences to navigate building technical skills. However, there are so many ways for students to build hands-on experience in the Humanities through avenues including laboratory work, cataloguing, or data entry.&nbsp; I advise students to really explore the variety of postings offered each semester for on-campus employment. These positions can offer you a chance to immerse yourself in research at an undergraduate level. This experience will not only support future applications but your personal familiarity with a variety of working environments.&nbsp;There really are more ‘arts’ laboratories than you may have previously thought.</p>

<p><strong>MUCEP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>Multiple placements&nbsp;between&nbsp;2018 - 2020&nbsp;as a Graphic Designer at the School of Pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>When I originally started in this role, I had limited experience in graphic design or branding, but I was given projects to work on, with great feedback from my supervisor. During my time as a MUCEP student, I created slide decks, posters and marketing materials. I also had the opportunity to design the School of Pharmacy’s annual reports for 2019, 2020, and 2021. I worked remotely, which was very convenient as a student. I checked in with my supervisor and she helped me hone my skills!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>My experience in this MUCEP position impacted my career path in a MAJOR way! I had been studying sociology (which is a field I love), but this placement gave me skills in an a separate area that I’d been curious about, but lacking experience in. I included this work experience in my resume, which helped me snag other marketing jobs, despite not having any formal education in marketing or design. Canva was a newer company when I started using their design software, but today you can find Canva experience as a qualification in many job descriptions. Without working with the School of Pharmacy in my MUCEP position, I would not have gotten the chance to really learn in a hands-on way. Now, I am working in Canva everyday as I create branding and marketing materials for clients of my small business!</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>I would highly recommend that students consider applying for any MUCEP or student role they are interested in, even if they don’t have direct experience with the particular role’s tasks. You likely already have some transferrable skills, and the point of experiential learning is to learn from a new experience. It can feel difficult or awkward to put yourself out there, but facing challenges is one of the best ways to learn and grow!</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?</strong></p>
<p>One of my favourite proud moments from my MUCEP actually occurred after the position was over. In 2021 I was a Master’s student, and had been visiting the Health Sciences Centre. When I walked into a waiting area, I noticed that the poster I’d created during my MUCEP position was taped to a wall. It was a smoking cessation program offered by the School. As I walked to my appointment, I noticed another poster, and then another— then I realized my posters were on multiple bulletin boards throughout the hospital. It is still exciting to see my work out in the public, even though it has been some time since my MUCEP position. I also want to give a special shoutout to Heidi Wicks and Marcia Porter who were my supervisors in the School of Pharmacy while I was an undergrad student. Heidi’s detailed feedback and Marcia’s frequent check-ins helped me immensely, and I am very grateful to have worked with them. :)</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>At the time, it was just nice to have a supplemental income.&nbsp; While working with Dr. Glassman, I was a full-time student and the extra money was a comfort. After completing my B.Ed., like a lot of folks with a social studies background, I ended up substituting for a year – so I continued to take a few courses to try and diversify my teaching background.&nbsp; The MUCEP earnings helped offset the cost of the French courses I was taking.</p>
<p>Additionally, the placements I did with Dr. Mike&nbsp;Collins during were really useful because he gave me a practical opportunity to practice the research skills that I was learning.&nbsp; It is one thing to learn about statistics in the classroom and practice the analysis with contrived data, it is something entirely different to use your own data where the outcome of the analysis could have impact on what a colleague does in the classroom (which is how I came to see Mike the longer we worked together: a colleague).&nbsp; In fact, the focus on the work Mike and I were doing ended up being the same topic that I used for my Master’s thesis (although I went back to Carleton University for my data collection).</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>My MUCEP work with Dr. Collins led to a lot of research that we co-authored and co-presented, particularly once I became a doctoral student at another institution. Some of this was done while I was still a Master’s student at Memorial, but most of it continued throughout the first three years of my doctoral program.&nbsp; These early scholarship experiences made me much more competitive when I hit the academic job market.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure I have any. These placements allowed me to get to know individual faculty members outside of the classroom in a way that I would never have been able to from&nbsp;just being a student of theirs.&nbsp;My work with Marc and Mike led to lifelong friendships.&nbsp; For years afterwards, whenever I came home for a visit I would be sure to make time to pop by Mike’s office or visit Marc at his home for a coffee and a chat.&nbsp; I presented and published with both – based on the work we did together and on several other topics of mutual interest.&nbsp;Marc in particular I got to know really well, along with his family.&nbsp; I was quite saddened when he passed earlier this year, and I still chat with his wife and son from time to time. The extra money was always a nice thing too, as was the chance to engage in being a part of academia before I even knew that I wanted to be a faculty member.&nbsp; So I guess it gave me a chance to explore areas that I would never have considered without the opportunities that these MUCEP placements provided.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?</strong></p>
<p>There used to be a bulletin board, most likely somewhere in the old TSC,&nbsp;which had all these little cue cards that had the title of the placement, who the supervisor was, and maybe a sentence or two about what they needed. I recall studying that bulletin board to try and find something of interest and contacting several of the folks on those cards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2003 MUCEP as a Marketing and Communications Assistant in the Faculty of Business Administration</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>I would say this experience had a positive impact as it allowed me to see a different side of the university experience that I would not have otherwise received. I also believe I did better in my studies that semester because I had a ‘fresh’ mind when it came to studying considering I had multi-focuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>It definitely positively impacted the early days of my career. During my placement, I spent the majority of my time&nbsp;assisting&nbsp;with event planning for some major events in the faculty,&nbsp; including the annual partners' dinner. I worked with&nbsp;faculty, staff and external&nbsp;stakeholders, which proved to be very helpful connections in my career journey&nbsp;and as part of my professional network. I have now&nbsp;been employed with RBC for the last 15 years in several different roles and I think that experience and those connections helped me differentiate myself from my peers and stand out in the job competitions once I graduated.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>I would strongly recommend them to take on an on-campus roles wherever they can while&nbsp;completing their studies. These&nbsp;positions&nbsp; really provide a different perspective on the university experience. Your studies come first for sure, however, if you can fit this into your busy schedules, I am confident you will see positive rewards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have had a very fruitful career in remote sensing of the ocean. It was nourished by the work placements I completed during my undergrad studies. Dr. Lambert later was my supervisor in my graduate work.</p>

<p>At 20 years old, I perhaps say the opportunity as a way to make some money to help me through school. Looking back at the opportunities, they helped me see a path and help realize a career. I could not think of what would have been had I not been employed by Dr. Lambert back then.</p>

<p><strong>MUCEP placement(s):</strong></p>
<p>1993 MUCEP in Acquisitions/Cataloguing at the Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) Library.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>MUCEP opportunities were the beginning of numerous friendships I still have today. I had always loved libraries and so being able to combine working in one, with my interest in Folklore, was the perfect student job.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>My MUCEP experience(s) solidified my interest in working in a library environment. During my placements, I was tasked with searching MARC records for various Folklore (and other) titles. I remember being stationed in the Circulation Department from time to time in order to use their computers- I eventually went on to work there full time. Working MUCEP positions also taught me how to balance my studies with work, to work not only independently but also as part of a team, and about the importance of creating a schedule and sticking to it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, I worked&nbsp;full-time in the QEII for almost five years before moving to the Folklore and Language Archive (MUNFLA) in May 2000. Those early MUCEP placements helped forge the path to my eventual career at Memorial. Today I’m on the other side of the coin as I’m now the one hiring MUCEP students to work in the Archive; my MUCEP experience really has come full circle!</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>Apply! Apply! Apply!&nbsp;On-campus employment positions offer invaluable experiential learning opportunities; you never know where that experience, combined with your education, might take you!</p>

<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>It gave me an opportunity to apply what I had been learning at school to real world settings and issues and to get my head into thinking about and helping to solve real world problems.&nbsp;I gained so many&nbsp;practical skills: social skills, how to use software (MS Suite, NVivo, SPSS) in a practical way. I even learned that if you fan your paper before you put it into the printer, the printer is much less likely to jam! It also helped me develop a professional identity and learn how to present myself in a professional work environment. These programs are such an amazing opportunity to provide skills and readiness for anyone interested in a pursuing any kind of professional career based on their academic studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It helped to make me feel a part of the Memorial University community. It is one thing to sit in a classroom and learn from your professors. It is another thing entirely to have an opportunity to be involved in research, knowledge generation and other processes in working directly with the faculty and staff at the university.&nbsp;I will be forever grateful for these opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>My experience with the counselling centre really helped me learn about qualitative research, which is an integral part of my job as a social worker. The research on resettlement really helped me to gain a better appreciation for the historical context in which I am both living and practicing as a social worker in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>If you are hoping to turn your degree into a career, business, or any kind of productive enterprise, these programs provide opportunities that you definitely will not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to make a special mention?</strong></p>
<p>One of my fondest memories was when Dr. Larry Felt, Sociology Professor, gave me a lift home from work one day, and we were discussing the brilliance of the MHAs representing us in the provincial government at that time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multiple placements&nbsp;between 1992 - 1993 at the&nbsp;PJ Gardiner Centre for Small Businesses</p>
<p><strong>How did having an on-campus job during your studies impact your student experience?</strong></p>
<p>I was really lucky to do some work as a fourth and final year undergraduate student in 1992, and early 1993 with the (then) PJ Gardiner Institute at the Faculty of Business Administration. They had me working on the research to help with a number of business plans. I had an awesome supervisor, Roger Power (has since left the university but we still remain friends). It was a great experience – it let me apply my theoretical knowledge to business planning and study development.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think&nbsp;your MUCEP placement impacted your career trajectory and/or prospects?</strong></p>
<p>The experience I had doing research and business plans has helped me (first of all) get a PhD and secondly work in consulting around the world and be one of only a handful of Certified Management Consultants here in Newfoundland and Labrador. As a professor, I still do work with the Gardiner Centre as a facilitator (although they don't do business planning anymore). And I teach Management Consulting here at the FBA (which includes business planning), so that seed of a SWASP program was an essential element in my professional and academic career.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for current and future students?</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest that they seek positions that are not only easy, but ones that get them out of their comfort zones. Universities are safe places, they allow you to fail and to learn from that failure. Programs like SWASP and MUCEP also allow you to figure out what you like and dislike from working. Taking advantage of opportunities that may not appear anywhere else unless through a MUCEP is great!&nbsp;</p>
