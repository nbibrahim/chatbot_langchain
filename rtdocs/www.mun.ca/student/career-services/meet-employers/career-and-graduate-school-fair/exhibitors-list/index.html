<p>Created in 1989 by a group of parents, the Fédération des parents francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador (FPFTNL) is a provincial organization that represents the interests of francophone parents and children in matters relating to school education but also to the development of early childhood services.</p>
<p>Since its creation and throughout its mandate, it has integrated early childhood and family services into its mission. These services are the primary recruitment and retention factors in French-language schools and communities. The FPFTNL is the province's only provider of French-language preschool and after-school services. It is a link between school, family, and community.</p>
<p>The Federation of parents aims for the full development of Francophone parents and children in their family, school, and community environment.</p>
<p>The Federation supports eligible parents, Francophone parent associations, parents and member parent committees who meet the criteria of Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in their efforts to create a Francophone environment conducive to the educational, linguistic, cultural and community development of their children.</p>
<p>The Federation accomplishes its mission by assuming the following mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representing parents’ committees and associations at a provincial, regional and national level.</li>
<li>Promoting synergy between committees and member parents’ associations.</li>
<li>Providing advice and specific tools to parents’ committees, associations and families.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The FPFTNL supports parents' committees as well as all groups of parents interested in developing new services in our Province.</p>

<div class="mwstitle section">HMCS&nbsp;<em>Cabot</em>&nbsp;was commissioned in 1949 to represent the navy in Canada’s new province. It was initially housed at Buckmaster’s Field as part of a tri-service headquarters. It experienced rapid growth, however, and moved first to Pleasantville, and finally to Pier 27 in St.&nbsp;John’s harbour.</div>
<div class="mwstitle section"></div>
<div class="mwstitle section"><em>Cabot</em>&nbsp;has always been an integral part of the local community, hosting many social functions and participating in many sporting activities, including rowing in the annual Royal St.&nbsp;John’s Regatta. This service to the community has continued.&nbsp;<em>Cabot</em>&nbsp;and its sailors provided temporary lodgings to 483&nbsp;people stranded in St.&nbsp;John’s when the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center towers in New York on 11&nbsp;September 2001 grounded all commercial flights.</div>

<li>sharing intelligence with trusted partners to support investigations, as well as disrupt and dismantle criminal operations</li>
