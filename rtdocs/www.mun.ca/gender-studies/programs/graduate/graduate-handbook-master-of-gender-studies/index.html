<h3><strong><span id="expectations"></span>Expectations and Regulations</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to the Master of Gender Studies program! We’re delighted you’re here.</p>
<p>As a student in the Master of Gender Studies program, you are expected to familiarize yourself with all Department of Gender Studies, School of Graduate Studies and University regulations and requirements pertaining to your status as a graduate student. You are also expected to engage – to the fullest extent of your abilities – with your course work and later, with your thesis or report research and writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We’ve outlined some of the important stages of your degree process below. At the end, in a section titled <strong><a href="#FormsandDocuments">Forms</a>,</strong>&nbsp;you’ll find links to the various forms and paperwork relevant to your degree.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Supervisors</p>
<p>All incoming students will be assigned a supervisor in their first year. Your supervisor will be a faculty member in Gender Studies whose research expertise most closely aligns with your own expressed interests. In your first year, they can help you navigate degree requirements, identify relevant elective courses, and discuss program completion options with you. Thesis students may elect to have two co-supervisors as their research projects develop. Please note that it is possible to change supervisors should your research interests change in the course of your first year in the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Registration</em></p>
<p>Please stop in and see Juanita Lawrence in the Gender Studies office (SN2028), before classes in the fall semester begin to ensure that the department has accurate contact information for you. She can also be reached via email at <a href="mailto:gndr@mun.ca">gndr@mun.ca.</a></p>
<p>The University Calendar lists all graduate courses and program requirements. It is available online at <a href="http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar.php">http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar.php</a>. All Master of Gender Studies students will need to complete GNDR6000, GNDR6100, and GNDR6200. Please note that these courses are only offered once per year.</p>
<p>Course offerings, descriptions, instructions for registration, and important deadlines are available online at <a href="https://my.mun.ca/">my.mun.ca</a>. This link is at the top of the Memorial University Homepage, or you can follow: <a href="https://login.mun.ca/">https://login.mun.ca</a></p>
<p><em>Coursework</em></p>
<p>As an MGS student, you will be required to complete the following Gender Studies courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>6000 Feminist Theory</li>
<li>6100 Feminist Epistemologies and Methodologies</li>
<li>6200Graduate Seminar in Gender Studies</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your background in Gender Studies, you may be required to complete one or more undergraduate courses. This will be outlined in your Offer of Admission.</p>
<p>Periodically, the Department offers one or more of the following elective courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>6300 Feminism as Community</li>
<li>6400-6409 Special Topics in Gender Studies</li>
<li>6500 Women and Communication Studies</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all elective courses will be offered in an academic year. MGS students can also take courses in other departments if these are relevant to their studies (and assuming they fit into their schedules). Please consult with your academic advisors about course selection.</p>
<p>Depending on your completion route (thesis, project or internship), you will be required to complete a further six (6) to nine (9) elective credit hours (2-3 graduate courses). You should select these in consultation with your supervisor (or co-supervisors). The Department Head will also need to approve these courses.</p>
<p>All students must complete the coursework required for their chosen degree path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, you will complete the majority of your course work within the first year of your program. During this time, we encourage you also to work with an advisor to discuss your general areas of research interest, proposed paths to completion, and possible supervisors. We also encourage you to familiarize yourself with the requirements relevant to your chosen path to completion. These can be found in the University <em><a href="http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar.php">Calendar</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Graduate Assistantships and Other Funding</em></p>
<p>The Department of Gender Studies has a number of graduate assistantships available (the exact number varies from year to year). These assistantships support undergraduate teaching at the first and second year level, and sometimes to further departmental projects, and they are awarded to qualified students in the program. We also have some other sources of funding, including two scholarships. We strive, as a department, to make this funding available in as equitable a way as possible.</p>
<p>The School of Graduate Studies maintains a <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/current/scholarships/">database</a> of all university scholarships and bursaries open to graduate students, and we encourage you to apply for them.</p>
<p>Permanent residents and Canadian citizens with strong academic backgrounds are encouraged to apply for Canada Graduate Scholarships (Master’s) offered by the <a href="https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/index-eng.aspx">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</a>. These are highly competitive scholarships and students are encouraged to start preparing their applications early. The department often hosts an internal SSHRC workshop and is committed to supporting students who want to apply for one of these grants.</p>
<p><em>Speakers’ Series</em></p>
<p>The Department of Gender Studies hosts an annual Speakers’ Series, featuring guest speakers from MUN, other universities, and the community at large. We expect that MGS students will attend all of these presentations.</p>
<p><em>Choosing a Supervisor or Co-Supervisors</em></p>
<p>It is your responsibility (with assistance from your advisor) to find appropriate supervisors or co-supervisors. Normally this is done during the second term of study. Your supervisors will strongly influence your academic and professional development. The choice of a supervisor will also shape your work environment and may also be able to offer some form of financial support. The success of your thesis or report depends, to a large extent, on the quality of the relationship that you develop with your supervisor or co-supervisors. There is a form for this. You can find it in the <a href="#FormsandDocuments">Forms </a>section, below.</p>
<p><em>Submitting Your Proposal</em></p>
<p>All Master of Gender Studies students will be required to submit their thesis, project or internship proposal to the Graduate Studies Advisory Committee. Proposal guidelines differ for each of the completion routes (more information can be found <a href="/gender-studies/media/production/memorial/academic/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/gender-studies/media-library/programs/graduate/THES,_INT_and_PROJ_Guidelines-2019.pdf">Graduate Proposal Guidelines</a>).</p>
<p>Your supervisor(s) must approve your proposal before your submission. Proposals will be assessed by members of the Graduate Studies Advisory Committee and must be approved before you can proceed with your proposed research. The GSAC evaluates proposals according to the guidelines found <a href="/gender-studies/media/production/memorial/academic/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/gender-studies/media-library/programs/graduate/THES,_INT_and_PROJ_Guidelines-2019.pdf">Graduate Proposal Guidelines</a>. The proposal is normally submitted no later than the end of your third semester in the program. <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/go/guid_policies/Guidelines_Theses_and_Reports.pdf"><br></a></p>
<p>If you are planning to complete research with “human subjects” (i.e., interviews, surveys, etc.) you must submit an application to the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/research/ethics/humans/icehr/">Interdisciplinary Committee on Ethics in Human Research (ICEHR)</a> demonstrating that your research adheres to guidelines. You must receive ICEHR approval before undertaking research with human subjects. ICEHR approval is not required prior to submission of your proposal. Your supervisor(s) will support you in developing your application.</p>
<p><em>Public Presentation</em></p>
<p>All MGS students are required to present a public presentation of their research. This presentation will generally be between 35 and 40 minutes in length. Presentations can only be scheduled after approval of your proposal. Depending on the number of students in the program, this presentation will either be scheduled during our regular speakers’ series or as part of a separate graduate student symposium.</p>
<p>Please note that you will be required to submit a completed request form (which must be signed by both you and your supervisor[s]). This form should be received at least one term in advance of your intended presentation. You can find a copy of the Public Presentation Form <a href="/gender-studies/media/production/memorial/academic/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/gender-studies/media-library/graduate/Graduate_Presentation_form.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Annual Forms</em></p>
<p>In each academic year, you will be required to submit a <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/Supervisory_Report.pdf">Graduate Student Annual Progress and Supervisory Report</a>. This form will also be completed by your supervisor(s). Students who have been enrolled in the program for longer than two years will be required to submit a revised timeline for thesis/report completion.</p>
<p><em>Time to Completion</em></p>
<p>Normally, full time students will complete their degree requirements in two years of study. However, students normally have up to a maximum of seven years in which to complete degree requirements.</p>
<p><em>Definition of a Full Time Student</em></p>
<p>According to the School of Graduate Studies, Memorial University a full-time graduate student is one who registers as such, devotes full time to their academic program and may not commit to more than 24 hours a week (including teaching assistant or research assistant duties) to matters other than the degree program (Regulation 2.3.8).</p>
<p><em>Definition of a Part Time Student</em></p>
<p>A part-time graduate student is one who is registered for the duration of a semester and is not classified as full-time (Regulation 2.3.8)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id="additional"></span>ADDITIONAL PROGRAM INFORMATION</h3>
<p><em>Student Contact Information</em></p>
<p>Please note that should you relocate during your academic program, it is your responsibility to notify the graduate program and your supervisors and to provide new contact information as soon as possible. If you neglect to do this, you may miss important information pertaining to your program. You can update your information by emailing Juanita at the general office (<a href="mailto:gndr@mun.ca">gndr@mun.ca</a>).</p>
<p>Please also note that it is university policy to communicate with graduate students through their MUN e-mail accounts. Please check this email regularly.</p>
<p><em>Program Leaves</em></p>
<p>The School of Graduate Studies has regulations governing Leaves of Absence for academic, family, medical, employment and financial reasons. Applications should normally be made at the end of the registration period in the first semester for which a leave is requested. Additional documentation may be required. The <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/loa.pdf">Request for Leave of Absence form</a> (found in the Forms section) must be signed by the supervisor, Department Head, and Dean, as appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Program Extensions</em></p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, application can be made for Extensions to Graduate Programs. In this case, students must complete the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/c5b_waiver.pdf">Appeal for Waiver of General Regulation, Period of Study</a> form, found in the Forms section. Additional documentation may be required. The required form must be signed by the supervisor, Department Head, and Dean, as appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Program Changes</em></p>
<p>Occasionally students may change from one program option to another (i.e., from a thesis to a project). If this is the case, students must complete the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/ChangeRoute.pdf">Change of Route</a> form. This form must be signed by the student, supervisor or co-supervisors, Department Head and School of Graduate Studies. Unless the new route is premised on a very similar proposal, it is also likely that you will need to submit a revised proposal for approval by the Graduate Studies Advisory Committee.</p>
<p><em>Supervisor Changes</em></p>
<p>If you need to make changes to your supervisor or co-supervisors, please complete the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sgs/ChangeProgram.pdf">Change of Program</a> form. This form must be signed by the student, supervisor or co-supervisors, Department Head and School of Graduate Studies.</p>
<p><em>Graduate Course Approval</em></p>
<p>Requests for approval of Graduate Courses must follow School of Graduate Studies guidelines and be accompanied by the appropriate form signed by the Department Head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id="internship"></span>INTERNSHIP REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>Candidates who choose the internship option will be required to complete a minimum of 18 credit hours of graduate level coursework, including required courses (normally 6 courses). Candidates will also be required to complete an internship.</p>
<p>The Master of Gender Studies internship will normally be for one semester (12 weeks; full time). If you are considering a part-time option, please note that part-time internship placements, over two semesters, will require approval from the proposed internship placement and from the Graduate Studies Advisory Committee, Department of Gender Studies.</p>
<p>Students completing the internship will, in cooperation with the Supervisor and the Graduate Coordinator, be required to locate not only a suitable placement, but also a field supervisor who can oversee your work. Although consideration will be given to all factors affecting the location and type of placement of Gender Studies internships, the final decision about the suitability of the internship rests with the Head, Graduate Coordinator, Department of Gender Studies and Dean, School of Graduate Studies.</p>
<p>Each internship placement will be supervised by the student's on-campus supervisor, and a field supervisor. A committee that includes all of these individuals as well as the Graduate Coordinator and the student must meet at least once during the internship period to make an assessment of the nature and quality of the intern’s progress and to approve any modifications to the internship. They will also meet once more when the internship report is nearing completion.</p>
<p>Should the internship be terminated prior to completion, the Graduate Coordinator may recommend one of the following options to the Dean, School of Graduate Studies:</p>
<ol>
<li>submission of a new internship proposal for a different field setting (only once)</li>
<li>election of the thesis/project option</li>
<li>awarding&nbsp;of a Graduate Diploma in Gender Studies (assuming all course requirements have been met)</li>
