Yet, the manner in which archaeology is represented in modern film is hardly realistic, or is it? The portrayal of archaeology in popular film will be discussed in order to determine what movies convey to the public about archaeological method and theory as well as the historical stories that archaeologists investigate.<br><strong>Lectures:</strong>&nbsp;Three hours per week<br><strong>Prerequisite:</strong>&nbsp;None<br><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This course may not be used toward a major or minor in Archaeology.</p>

The course explores the concept of gender and considers varied gendered identities found in material and textual evidence.

<p><strong>Linguistics 2300</strong><br><strong>Philosophy of Language and Mind</strong>&nbsp;(same as Philosophy 2300) is a survey of philosophical thinking about human language and thought, and about how these phenomena relate to the rest of the natural world.

<p><strong>Linguistics&nbsp;2800<br></strong><strong>Linguistics for Language Learners</strong>&nbsp;(same as Language 1800)&nbsp;introduces and explains the concepts and terminology useful for formal language instruction. The primary focus is on understanding the structure of various levels of language (meaning, pronunciation, words, sentences, conversations, society and culture, and change), specifically as these structures relate to second language learning. The secondary focus is on research on learning and teaching and the natural acquisition of language.<br><strong>Lectures:</strong>&nbsp;Three hours per week<br><strong>Prerequisite:</strong>&nbsp;None</p>
