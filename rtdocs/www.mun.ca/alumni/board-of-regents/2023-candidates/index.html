<p>A results oriented and highly energetic professional with over twenty seven years of experience in the telecommunications industry with a proven track record in leadership, planning and business acumen. I have a strong adaptability to new technologies and changing business needs coupled with a diversified employment background covering wireless product development, customer engagement and support and management of high performing cross functional&nbsp;teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If chosen as a member of the Board of Regents, this experience would bring valuable private sector insights on using advanced technology and innovation to bring creative and forward looking methodologies to the management and administr­­­­ation of the university. Having grown up in a small community in Newfoundland and Labrador and attending Memorial University has laid the foundation for acquiring an understanding of some of the key challenges facing the students, faculty and administration and how some of these challenges can be overcome through adoption of transparent communication in policy setting and the use of collaborative and consensus based approaches to decision making.</p>
<p>My main interest in obtaining a position on the Board of Regents is to positively influence the future direction of the university in terms of policy, management and administration and to been seen as an active member contributing to improved stakeholder outcomes.</p>

<p>All universities are struggling to stay relevant, and MUN is no exception. As we have seen in the recent faculty strike, lawsuits against critics, and dismissal of the dean, the old, neoliberal management style is not working anymore.</p>
<p>And good riddance to it.</p>
<p>As a PhD in Global society studies who researched the effect of Neoliberal Discourse on media institutions, I can show the way to a more inclusive and progressive leadership. As a NunatuKavut and former expat who has faced discrimination and harassment, I can see and call out inequality. As a former university student, faculty member, and committee member, I know that listening to all the voices of the university community is the only way to make informed and effective changes.</p>
<p>I promise to make the following practices central to fulfilling my mandate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continued support and expansion of what works, and modification of what doesn’t based on feedback from faculty, staff, and students</li>
<li>Real representation and for all members of society, not just symbolic changes</li>
<li>Transparency in decision making and improved communication in and outside MUN</li>
<li>Increased links with other institutions worldwide to benefit student career choices</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you agree with my vision, and look forward to your support.</p>

<p>My name is David (Dave) Dove, and I attended Memorial from 1985 to 1990 and graduated with a Bachelor of Education (Elementary) and a Masters of Education in School Leadership.&nbsp; I just retired from a 30-year career in Education with the vast majority of that time being spent in School Administration. While at MUN, I lived in residence (Coughlan College) for five years and served as the Chairperson of Council of the Students’ Union for four years and was the Chief Returning Officer for the CSU for numerous general elections, by-elections and referendums. I also held various employment positions on campus including the campus post office, CSU Concert Staff, and at the periodical department at the Queen E II. I was very involved with the MUN Campus life and thoroughly enjoyed both my academic and social life there.</p>
<p>My main reason for putting my name forward as an Alumni Representative on the MUN Board of Regents is to have a voice for the proud alumni of MUN, and to bring a local, Newfoundland perspective to the leadership of the university. Recent decisions made public at MUN have caused me great concern about the tradition and culture of the university. We must find a heathy balance between the tradition and history of the university and correctness. I am not a subscriber to the “cancel” culture trend currently taking place in our society and believe that compromise and common sense can prevail over absoluteness.</p>

As a professional investor and economist, I have extensive expertise in evaluating and optimizing financial and economic proposals. I also have experience in the three key functions of a university: Teaching, Research, and Community. During graduate school, I taught in the business and economics departments and was also the manager and a board member of Simon Fraser University’s campus newspaper. Though my current research is proprietary, I remain a part of the broader academic community, attending several conferences annually. At MUN in the 90s, I was a varsity athlete. Go Sea Hawks!</p>
<p>MUN is a key ingredient to Newfoundland’s social and economic progress. The education of our population drives our productivity and keeps us competitive in a constantly evolving world, but it also informs our electorate and produces a thriving social and cultural home for our families. Such an important institution needs strong oversight that represents all its shareholders, and I would take that responsibility very seriously. Academic excellence, quality education, and economic sustainability are values I will bring to the Board.</p>

<p class="p1">I, Mary Feltham, am an alumna of Memorial University with two degrees (BSc in Psychology and BScN) completed at the Grenfell Campus. I strive to consistently demonstrate my commitment to the betterment of Memorial University by working with its students, faculty, staff, and administration.</p>
<p class="p1">I have an extensive eight-year involvement in student politics as through my elected positions within the Grenfell Campus Student Union. I have been, and continue to be, a strong advocate for the enhancement of the university and believe my advocacy experience will be a strong asset when it comes to important decision making on the Board of Regents.</p>
<p class="p1">I am eager to continue seeking opportunities to foster positive change within the university. I aim to continue to listen to and share the concerns of not only current or future students, but also all those who are a part of the Memorial community. I am interested in continuing conversations regarding how we can make education truly accessible for all, while maintaining the high-quality reputation that our institution currently holds.</p>
<p class="p1">Currently, I work with students across the province, and hear their concerns at a national level through my new position of Chairperson (CFSNL). This position provides me with insight on tactics used to optimize universities nationally.</p>
<p class="p1">In summary, I am dedicated to consistently advocating to enhance all aspects of Memorial University. My active involvement in student politics, combined with my academic achievements and professional experience, make me an outstanding candidate for the Board of Regents Alumni Representative position.</p>

<p>Nominee Statement/Memorial Board of Regents/David B Guy</p>
<p>I believe higher education is the “silver bullet” for our time, when we are facing unprecedent&nbsp; and multivariate challenges with our current way of life.&nbsp; Climate Change and the need for serious collective action; pressures being placed on our political and social institutions; the foundational need for more diversity and inclusion.&nbsp; These are enormous concurrent challenges today and our educational institutions need to continue to rise to the occasion.&nbsp; Higher education turns us toward thinkers of the past in helping to understand how we got here and teaches us to think our way through problems of today so that we can enjoy a meaningful future together.</p>
<p>Memorial has been the standard-bearer for this in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador.&nbsp; I have worn my Memorial heritage proudly throughout my professional career and I care deeply that Memorial continues to be a leader internationally as a sought-after and highly worthy place of learning.</p>

<p>As a student at Memorial University, I learned a ton about myself, and the world. One of the most important things I learned was the value a university has not only for an individual, but for society. I believe a strong, vibrant, and diverse university is key to the growth and sustainability of Newfoundland and Labrador. I would like to help shape an institution that means so much to me and my community.</p>
<p>I believe in the strength and resiliency of rural small-town living, and the role the university can play in its development and growth. I was born and raised on the west coast of Newfoundland, and after many years living elsewhere, moved back home to the best coast. I now live in Norris Point with my wife and son. I am an active volunteer in my community. Currently, I am chair of the board of directors of the Trails Tales Tunes Festival, and a member of the Bonne Bay Cottage Hospital Heritage Corporation, a group dedicated in the adaptive reuse of an old hospital; previously I was chair of Artforce NL (formerly For the Love of Learning).</p>
<p>I graduated from Memorial University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts in History and Political Science. I also hold a Master of Arts in Community Development from the University of Victoria, and a journalism diploma from the College of the North Atlantic. I work for the federal government in beautiful Gros Morne National Park.</p>

<p>I was one of many international students from Malaysia at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) in the 1990s. I completed my dietetic education at MUN, followed by a dietetic internship in Victoria and Vancouver and a Master of Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC).</p>
<p>I have now been a Registered Dietitian at Providence Health Care, based at St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver for over 24 years, with experience in clinical care, education, research, and management overseeing the daily operations and personnelling of the department’s over 70 dietitians. I am also a Clinical Instructor at UBC, supporting dietetic students’ practice education.</p>
<p>Recently, I completed a six-year term on the Board of Directors for the College of Dietitians of BC (CDBC), with the final two as Chair. Some of our major undertakings included overseeing the strategic plans, pandemic response, modernization of the BC’s healthcare regulatory systems and fostering cultural safety and humility, equity, diversity and inclusion. I have also served on the CDBC Inquiry Committee providing oversight for public safety and fair deliberations for registrants.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful to many kind individuals at MUN and in Newfoundland during my time there, which ended up having a significant impact on my life trajectory. It has therefore long been my desire to serve the University and community one day. I have gained the experience, knowledge and skills critical for effective contributions to Board work, and it would be my honour to serve on the Board of Regents. Thank you.</p>

My involvement with various community groups has allowed me to transform our client base and build relationships with local business owners while showcasing myself as a strong mentor for many students and alumni. The experience I bring will help to assist the instution in realizing its strategic objectives while championing excellence and innovation.</p>

<p>Megan Murphy received a Linguistics/Business BA from Memorial University in 2010 and OHS certificate from University of NB in 2016. She served with the Canadian Armed Forces for 4 years as a Human Relations/Finance clerk. She has co-created and worked for RODS for 4 years as the Office/Research Manager, which involves running the day-to-day business operations as well as controlling all aspects of the research contracts outside the fishing season.</p>
<p>This includes educational institution contracts, DFO research tenders, private company requests, oil and gas work, funding program applications and more. It has been Megan’s ability to engage with industry and knowledge of the application process for government work that has led to the influx of marine research work and the need for the two research vessels her company provides out of St. John’s, NL. She has been working tirelessly to seek out partners, opportunities, collaborations, and other ways to bring new marine research business to the province. After 2 years of really learning the industry’s needs, Megan has successfully cultivated multiple short-term and long-term contracts which has led to the success of the research side of the business. Operating two research vessels both domestically and internationally 12 months of the year along with having 3 boys under 5, she is not shy to long hours and a lot of hard work which is the reason why she is an excellent fit for the board of regents and will bring a lot of practical and technical knowledge to the marine research transportation sector of MUN and MI.</p>

<p>Here’s the candidate narrative from campaign headquarters:</p>
<p>“Dean Oliver, a Newfoundland-born alumnus, is a senior executive, scholar, and thought leader with 25 years of distinguished public service. In 2010, he was knighted by Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands in the Order of Orange-Nassau for ‘service to society.’ Currently the interim director-general and vice president of the Canadian War Museum, he is one of&nbsp; Canada's&nbsp;most influential and best-known cultural innovators and public communicators. He is a lecturer, writer, and mentor, with deep experience in research, policy, academia, museology, and Indigenous relations.”</p>
<p>And here it is from the ‘corner bums’ who actually know me:</p>
<p>“Dean O bats left and grew up in Higher Levels, spending too much time shagging flies and too little studying. MUN turned him into a history nerd and a life-long nag about how history matters. He’s been banging on lately about MUN having lost its way, mired in successive self-inflicted crises, wasting money, and pursuing a generic ‘future’ strategy at the expense of demonstrable service to the province and its people. He believes fervently in MUN’s founding mission and will use his 1/30<sup>th</sup> share of influence to steer the university back towards it. He is dogged, and will disrupt.”</p>
<p>I believe MUN must rededicate itself to the unique excellence of being by, for, and about <em>us</em>. This is true innovation, true change. Chasing international tuition and global status, in an increasingly crowded field, to fund expensive, dubious expansions is innovation’s opposite.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering voting for my election to the Memorial University Board of Regents. I have spent a significant period throughout my career in higher education, including Memorial as both an administrative manager and sessional instructor. Since my nursing convocation from Memorial, my focus for volunteerism has been diverse within the public sector and professional associations. I believe my work experiences and board positions offer a distinctive set of perspectives that would contribute to board operations and governance. I have experience on many committees and Boards of Directors, many within the higher education sector, and have demonstrated a focus on promoting sustainable growth through dynamic, responsive service aligned with measurable fiscal and academic outcomes.</p>
<p>My work experience includes leadership roles within the private sector, healthcare, education, and government. Until February 2024, I serve as Special Advisor to the Provost on Organizational Strategy at the University of Waterloo. I provide leadership support and advice to the Vice President Academic &amp; Provost in effecting process, system and organizational improvements across all academic and administrative portfolios. From 2014-2023 I was the Associate Provost Human Resources at UW; from 2011-2013 as Vice President at Eastern Health.</p>
<p>I am very familiar with the challenges, expectations, and opportunities facing higher education in Canada and globally having served on higher education boards that include the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Lean Higher Education, and Network for Change and Continuous Innovation. Serving on the Memorial University Board of Regents would be a tremendously fulfilling role.</p>

<p>Jennifer Tipple (she/her) is Director of Strategy for End Homelessness St. John’s (EHSJ). Here is a summary of the value she would bring to the Board:</p>

<li>At EHSJ, she works with diverse stakeholder groups to create solutions for complex multi-system problems</li>
<li>She earned her MBA from INSEAD in 2014, attending both campuses in France and Singapore, and she understands the experience of being an international student</li>
<li>She also has career experience in post-secondary education, through five years working with College of the North Atlantic’s Qatar campus</li>

<p>My name is Kyle Vardy and I am nominating myself for an alumni representative role on the Board of Regents. I graduated from Memorial with a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in 2007 and a Master of Employment Relations (MER) in 2012. I work as a Labour Relations Officer with the Registered Nurses Union where I have been an advocate for union members for seven years. In addition, I have been a Per Course Instructor within the Faculty of Business in the last year.</p>
<p>I have nominated myself for this role because I am passionate about Memorial University and the purpose I see it serving. It is my view that the University is a bedrock of our province and that our capacity to provide all types of higher education here within Newfoundland and Labrador is invaluable to people who choose this place. Cohesion in systems and processes amongst different University Departments, transparency to University stakeholders, lowering class sizes in graduate programs and democratic processes within the university are some of the priorities that I would be considering in a role sitting on the Board.</p>
<p>As a Board of Regents member I would bring an assertive approach that I feel is well balanced by my emotional intelligence. I love working directly with people and speaking to large groups about topics I believe are important. I hope you’ll consider me when you cast your vote. <br> <br> Sincerely,<br>Kyle Vardy</p>

<p>I obtained my <strong>Engineering and Masters of Engineering degrees at MUN</strong>.&nbsp; During that time I was <strong>very active in university affairs</strong>, such as being President of the Engineering Society, and as a Grad Rep on several university-wide committees.</p>
<p>I bring to the table the experiences of <strong>a career at senior and executive levels</strong> with large companies, including President of Enmax Power.</p>
<p>I have always been <strong>a very active community volunteer</strong> with multiple chartable and industry organizations, including several years as Board Chair of the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra Board.</p>
<p>I also bring to the table the experiences of being <strong>on over 20 boards over the years</strong>, and have earned the <strong>ICD.D designation</strong> with the Institute of Corporate Directors.</p>
<p>I have <strong>actively supported MUN</strong> over the years.&nbsp; I was <strong>founding Chair of the very successful annual Affinity Calgary fundraising dinner</strong> 17 years ago, and have remained on the organizing committee since then.&nbsp; I was <strong>Calgary Co-Chair of MUN’s very successful “Dare To” major fundraising campaign</strong> in 2011-2015.</p>
<p>The Board of Regents with 30 members is very large, and along with the limits of being a Provincial Government Board, could potentially be cumbersome and difficult to make a difference.&nbsp; However I look forward to the challenge.&nbsp; I believe that with my background with community volunteerism, with MUN in particular, and with my work and Board experiences, I will be able to contribute to the continued success of our great Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

<p>I have been actively involved in volunteerism in my community having served for three terms on the Springdale Town Council, the last term serving as Deputy Mayor. I was Chairman of the Springdale Volunteer Fire Department for three years. I also Served on the Emerald Zone Economic Development Board for three years, two as Vice Chairman and one as Chairman. I was a Member of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters Board of Directors Newfoundland Division and was a&nbsp; Founding member and President of the Newfoundland Boatbuilders Association leading the group on 12 Boat shows around the world.</p>

I work well in a group&nbsp; and am a team player who always shows my fellow co-workers the utmost of respect while keeping the Vision and Goals of the organization in the forefront and Honesty and Integrity are my guiding pillars.</p>
<p>I am a very proud Newfoundlander and Memorial University is dear to my heart. My pride and love of Rural Newfoundland runs deep in my veins. Having over 35 years experience in doing business, living and breathing Rural Newfoundland life, I feel this makes me well suited to represent the educational needs and values of rural Newfoundland responsibly as a member of our Board of Regents.</p>
<p>I am confident that the education I received from MUNs Business school has been invaluable in my career choice. I would consider it an honour to serve on MUNS Board of Regents and I am ready and willing to make a positive contribution, giving back to an institution that means so much to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I respectively ask for your support in the 2023 Election for MUNS Board of Regents.</p>
