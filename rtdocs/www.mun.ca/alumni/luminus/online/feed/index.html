        <p><strong>JESSICA MELVIN (B.Sc.’14)</strong> grew up on the water. The ocean was a stone’s throw from her Bauline East home, located along Newfoundland’s scenic Southern Shore. She remembers with fondness spending summers with her dad in a boat, listening to him share his knowledge about the sea.</p>
<p>“Whether we were jigging for cod, throwing a cast net for capelin, scooting around the islands and caves in the area, whale watching or tying up under La Manche bridge for a break with friends, my time on the water growing up is something I will never forget,” said Ms. Melvin.</p>
<p>She also credits Memorial — a place shaped by wind, water and ice — for influencing her life. With more than 40 per cent of its research ocean-related, Memorial is recognized internationally as a leader in the field.</p>
<p>As a student, Ms. Melvin studied at the <a href="https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx">Bonne Bay Aquarium and Research Station</a> in Norris Point, N.L., a place she calls a “gem” for marine biology research.</p>        </div>

<p>He helmed the synthesis of the $650-million, worldwide <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_snelgrove_a_census_of_the_ocean?language=en">Census of Marine Life</a> program, one of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted, which included a network of more than 2,700 census scientists from more than 80 countries. He also led the Canadian Healthy Oceans Network for over a decade, with Memorial as the lead institution, focusing on biodiversity and conservation strategies for Canada’s changing oceans.</p>
<p>Dr. Snelgrove currently serves as associate scientific director with the <a href="https://www.ofi.ca/">Ocean Frontier Institute</a>, a historic partnership between Memorial, Dalhousie University and the University of Prince Edward Island that focuses on challenges and solutions for safe and sustainable ocean development.</p>
<p>“The ocean is the most pervasive habitat on our planet, and we’re seeing dramatic change in it that clearly impacts all of life on Earth. The profound connection between Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and the ocean has shaped who we are and what we will be, so we must strive to ensure a sustainable and healthy ocean in order for this province to thrive for generations to come.”</p>
<p>Through the decades, Memorial has positively shaped the lives and careers of thousands of its researchers, community partners, students and alumni.</p>        </div>

<p>Dr. Barbara Neis (MA’81), Honorary Research Professor, first travelled to Newfoundland and Labrador more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p>“I came here originally for my honeymoon,” she said. “I had a professor at York University who told me about a place where you could stand on the land and see the ocean on both sides—the isthmus of Avalon near Chance Cove.</p>
<p>“I always wanted to see that, but actually didn’t get to see it on my honeymoon, only later,” Dr. Neis continued. “We did get to Cape St. Mary’s and fell in love with the Cape Shore. My late husband and I decided to come back to do graduate work, and so I did a master of arts degree in sociology starting in 1976.”</p>
<p>Dr. Neis recently retired after an influential career in the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sociology/">Department of Sociology</a>, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. She was named John Lewis Paton Distinguished University Professor in 2017.</p>
<p>A member of the Order of Canada and a fellow of the <a href="https://rsc-src.ca/">Royal Society of Canada</a>, Dr. Neis specializes in multidisciplinary, community engaged research and has made groundbreaking contributions to research on social and environmental issues facing coastal communities around the world.</p>
<p>A prolific researcher, she has focused on issues such as gender and fisheries, fishers’ knowledge and science, maritime occupational health and safety, rebuilding collapsed fisheries and fishing communities and work-related mobility.</p>
<p>“The ocean environment and the people who make their living from that environment have been front and centre in much of the work I have done,” said Dr. Neis, who was recently named president of the Royal Society of Canada’s Academy of Social Sciences.</p>

<p>“We have long taken for granted that the ocean is bountiful and that we can always count on it to provide food and other vital services. We now know better: unless we take care of the ocean, we will be in major trouble.We need people to care more about the ocean and do their part to protect it.”</p>
<h2>DR. MARJAN BOROOJERDI</h2>
<p>Memorial University’s reputation for oceans excellence drew Dr. Marjan Boroojerdi (PhD’20) to Newfoundland and Labrador from Iran. As a fledgling change-maker, she focused on better understanding the dangers posed by the sea ice to ships and off-shore structures as part of her doctoral degree. Now based in Ontario, Dr. Boroojerdi says her time at Memorial was “life-changing.”</p>        </div>

        <p>“Memorial is one of the leading research institutions in cold-oceans, Arctic and ocean engineering fields. So, when I decided to study abroad, Memorial was of course an obvious choice.”</p>
<p>When it comes to ocean research, Memorial’s physical location — perched on Canada’s North Atlantic coast — provides the university a competitive edge.</p>
<p>That wonderful sea, as alumnus and acclaimed author <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/playwright-producer-cahill-dead-at-77-1.587691">Tom Cahill</a> described it, is inspiring the next generation of researchers, partners, students and alumni.

        <p class="p2"><strong>WHEN MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY COLLEGE</strong> officially opened in St. John’s on Sept. 15, 1925, there were more people than seats in the Parade Street building.</p>
<p class="p2">Attendees spilled out onto the balconies overlooking the building’s main hall.</p>
<p class="p2">The <i>Evening Telegram </i>called the college “Newfoundland’s Great Advance” and hailed the opening as an “epoch-marking event” that signified the hope, progress and development of an entire country.</p>
<p class="p2">In its inaugural report, students and faculty are described as “one enlarged family with one heart and mind.” There is an archival photo of this first class of 57 students and five faculty posing in front of the college’s concrete columns wearing scholarly gowns. They look at the camera with the same alchemy of joy and trepidation on their faces that can be seen on many of today’s students. Near the centre is <a href="https://www.mun.ca/main/history/timeline/the-20s/john-lewis-paton/">John Lewis Paton</a>, the college’s president. He seems to be daring the students to dream of a better future only they themselves can build. And that is exactly what they did.</p>

PHOTO: SUBMITTED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p class="p2">Memorial University College’s first graduate was a trailblazer: a woman. Dr. Helena Frecker (née McGrath) was a recipient of the Jubilee Scholarship. She graduated from the college in 1926, and then earned a BA(Hons.) and an MA from the University of Toronto in 1928 and 1930. She would go on to teach at Memorial University off and on until 1975.</p>
<p class="p2">From 1974-75 Memorial University celebrated its 50th year. As part of that celebration, Dr. Frecker was awarded an honorary degree. In her convocation address, she shared her impressions of her time at the college and the influence Paton had on his students.</p>
<p class="p3">“He tried to pass on to us the conviction that we as a privileged few (perhaps through circumstance rather than through any intrinsic merits of our own) must always remember that for every privilege, for every right, there is a corresponding duty and responsibility. It was our duty to turn our college education not only to personal profit and advancement, but to the good of the whole community.”</p>        </div>

        <h2 class="p2">THE EARLY YEARS</h2>
<p class="p3">During the next decade, the college continued to grow. By 1935 there were 220 students and 12 faculty. There were four labs, a lecture hall, a gymnasium and a library that housed a collection of 8,000 books.</p>
<p class="p3">A pivotal turning point came in 1949. One of the first acts by the provincial government of the new Canadian province of Newfoundland was to create legislation making Memorial University a degree-granting institution.</p>
<p class="p3">Then-premier Joseph Smallwood stated during his address to the Newfoundland House of Assembly on Aug. 11, 1949:</p>
<p class="p3">“There is no reason, if we have the vision and if we have the courage . . . the university of Newfoundland for its size should not be the most distinguished university in the whole world.”</p>
<p class="p4">Then, in 1951, the provincial government chose an 80-acre site for a new campus on Elizabeth Avenue, which was at that time on the outskirts of St. John’s.</p>        </div>

        <h2 class="p2">THE FIRST 100 YEARS</h2>
<p class="p3">Memorial University continues to evolve and adapt: first with its Elizabeth Avenue campus and subsequently with the establishment of professional schools in nursing, medicine, social work, engineering and the creation of new programs and campuses.</p>
<p class="p3">In an address to the St. John’s Rotary Club in 1961, Moses O. Morgan, then a dean of arts and science at Memorial, described Memorial during this important chapter of expansion and growth:</p>
<p class="p3">“[Memorial] is and must remain unique, with its roots deep in the traditions of the university college and more profoundly in the traditions of this province. It must remain of Newfoundland, reflecting the ethos of its people and their aspirations, as it remains both the gateway and a contributor to a fuller life.”</p>
<p class="p3">From 57 to more than 19,000 students from 115 countries, Memorial University now has six campuses: <a href="https://www.mun.ca">St. John’s campus</a> (1961), <a href="https://www.mun.ca/harlow/">Harlow Campus</a> (1968), <a href="https://www.grenfell.mun.ca/Pages/home.aspx">Grenfell Campus</a> (1975), <a href="https://www.mi.mun.ca">Marine Institute</a> (1992), <a href="https://www.mun.ca/signalhill/">Signal Hill Campus</a> (2018) and <a href="https://www.mun.ca/labradorinstitute/">Labrador Campus</a> (2022).</p>
<p class="p3">Memorial’s greatest accomplishment is the cumulative sea change of its more than 100,000 alumni from near and far, who carry with them a connection, a sense of community and an experience intrinsically tied to their time at Memorial University in Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p class="p4">Almost 100 years ago, John Lewis Paton wrote Memorial’s motto himself in the first college report, “Launch forth into the deep.” It described the meaning of the motto and why he chose it: use the power of education to escape from the smallness and narrowness of life and think about life in expansive ways.</p>
<p class="p2">This motto remains enshrined in the work of Memorial University’s students, faculty and staff and reminds us to make the world a better place, wherever we are.</p>

        <p class="p3"><strong>IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR</strong>, Dr. Bill Montevecchi is a household name.</p>
<p class="p3">The Memorial professor and 2022 honorary doctorate recipient’s frequent media appearances advocating for seabirds and wildlife, conservation and environmental assessments have been pivotal in educating the public about the dangers of mistreating the planet’s ecosystems.</p>
<p class="p3">As one of the world’s leading seabird experts, his devotion to the natural world is a cry for change, working towards “the personal and public embracing an ethic that accommodates the natural environment and blunts excessive consumerism,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">Dr. Montevecchi influenced the career paths of his three children, all alumni of Memorial’s Faculty of Science, Nicholas Montevecchi (B.Sc.’06), Gioia Montevecchi (B.Sc.’06, B.Sc.(Hons.)’07, M.Sc.’12) and Marina Montevecchi (B.Sc.’13).</p>
<p class="p3">Gioia, Dr. Montevecchi’s oldest daughter, works as a protected-area planner with the Innu Nation. She supports the development of an Innu-led stewardship plan for Akamiu-UapishkU, a large area of pristine wilderness and integral part of Nitassinan, the Innu homeland. The area includes a new national park reserve, a proposed provincial waterway park and vast stretches of boreal and sub-arctic lands.</p>
<p class="p3">“The Earth is rapidly losing entire ecosystems,” she said. “Society values economic development over environmental protection. Once the wild is gone, it cannot come back as wild as it was.”</p>
<p class="p4">In this intimate and illuminating Q&#038;A, father and daughter reminisce, praise the foundational importance of family, cite the necessity of laughter and philosophize about society, mortality and the future.</p>        </div>

        <p class="p2"><b>HW: How did having Bill Montevecchi as a dad influence your path? </b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>GM: </b>Both Dad and Mum really instilled in us that it’s not so much what we choose to do in life, but how we choose to do it. Dad taught us what it is to bring a whole self into every part of a life, to show up honestly, be forthright in what we believe in and always let curiosity guide us through challenge and conflict. That’s a game-changer because it requires humility. Dad is as socially conscious as he is environmentally [conscious]. We always had injured, sick, wayward birds in our house growing up. Murres, razorbills, petrels, gannets, cormorants, owls, ravens, hawks, loons, songbirds . . . we cared for them as a family. We held space for the effects of climate change, oil spills, light pollution, development, right in our home. My most treasured memories are when we would go to the wharf in Portugal Cove long after dark to release tiny storm petrels over the ocean. We would hold them in our small hands and with all our might, pitch them clear out into the dark sky over the black ocean, throwing our arms wide. We never knew which ones made it and which ones didn’t, but that was all part of it. And Dad was a total goofball growing up. Laughter was central for us as a family. Dad brought us into the realm of joy of his professional life. We were truly a part of it. As preschoolers – with Mum and Dad we camped by a large storm petrel colony on Green Island off the tip of the Burin Peninsula. When we were a couple of years older, we stayed in the lighthouse on Baccalieu Island – home to the largest Leach’s storm petrel colony in the world. We banded birds and were enthralled by the wonder and enchantment of these tiny resilient seabirds, their nocturnal behaviour and their colony activity.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>HW: Did you always know what Gioia would become passionate about in her life? </b></p>

<p class="p4"><b>BM: </b>I really never know these things. What I did know was that Gioia was strong and independent. I was always impressed with the friends that she made, supported and valued — a diversity of people from all walks and orientations. That hasn’t changed. Gioia is brave and will do what she thinks is right, even at personal risk and loss. It is that type of action that may not be overtly rewarded but which earns respect. Her work ethic is intense and she fully immerses herself in the task at hand. She has a prowess and wisdom beyond her years. I often call on her when I have extremely difficult decisions to make. We often discuss conceptual issues, and I gain from Gioia’s developing perspectives about the land and how to live with it and accommodate. I sometimes refer to her as “daughter of wisdom.”</p>
<p class="p3"><b>HW: In thinking about making change, what’s important? </b></p>
<figure id="attachment_2963" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-2963 size-medium" src="http://www.mun.ca/alumni/luminus/online/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/luminus_spring_2023_Bill-and-Gioia-Cape-St.-Marys-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.mun.ca/alumni/luminus/online/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/luminus_spring_2023_Bill-and-Gioia-Cape-St.-Marys-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.mun.ca/alumni/luminus/online/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/luminus_spring_2023_Bill-and-Gioia-Cape-St.-Marys.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Drs. Gioia and Bill Montevecchi tagging gannets at Cape St. Mary’s Ecological Reserve. PHOTO: SUBMITTED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p class="p2"><b>GM: </b>It’s important to acknowledge we are a part of the planet’s ecosystems, not at the top of its hierarchy. We have one planet with finite resources. Eighty per cent of the remaining biodiversity in the world is found in places Indigenous people inhabit. Ninety per cent of Canada’s protected areas established in the last 20 years resulted from collaboration with First Nations and Inuit communities. It is very important to ensure the resources and people required to protect healthy ecosystems and preserve sacred connections to it are fully supported now and into the future. To that end, we need to meet this global challenge with curiosity and unity. I believe it’s important we check our biases and surround ourselves with people who have a different world view, who have had experiences we haven’t, especially when those new learnings make us uncomfortable. We are stronger and make more informed action that way.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>BM: </b>I continue to rely on public outreach and awareness of the pervasiveness of our influences and perturbations on our natural environment. Every time I see a waterway being infilled or forest cleared for development large or small, I have a gut reaction that it all seems unnecessary and sacrilegious. We can act. We must act or otherwise assume responsibility for our complicity. It’s a magnificent world.</p>        </div>

        <p class="p2"><strong>UP UNTIL 2022</strong>, Royal St. John’s Regatta rules dictated that male crews rowed a 2.45-kilometre course at Quidi Vidi Lake and women rowed half that, or 1.225 kilometres.</p>
<p class="p2">It was a distinguishing difference between the Royal St. John’s Regatta and any other regatta in the world. In the Olympics, for example, the standard rowing race course for men and women is the same: 2,000 metres.</p>
<p class="p2">However, during the past 30 years, some participants of the Royal St. John’s Regatta advocated for the option to compete in either distance — meaning women should be able to enter the short or long course, as should the men.</p>
<p class="p2">On Aug. 5, 2022, for the first time, women’s teams rowed the long course on Regatta Day. Team Verso took first place with a time of 10:28, with three other women’s crews participating. Each member of Team Verso are also members of the Memorial community — something they say factored into the historic moment in a number of ways.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>‘Part of who I am’ </b></h2>
<p class="p2">“Each of our experiences at Memorial contributes to our personal and professional identities and likely paved the way for us to end up here on this crew,” said coxswain Emma Ramsay (B.Kin.’19, M.Sc.(Kin.)’21). “We are privileged to be a very educated group, and the opportunities we have from our academic and professional careers helped us to be able to row and participate in this movement.”</p>
<p class="p2">For rower Connie Duffett (B.Comm.’02, MER’11), her Memorial University experience taught her the importance of teamwork, leadership, hard work and to “never accept the status quo.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Each and every member of our crew is a leader and an advocate for positive change,” she said. “Memorial is absolutely a part of who I am and has taught me skills to influence change. Rowing, like many other sports and especially for women, promotes confidence. I would love to see Memorial grow its athletics with a rowing crew. Amazing things can happen!”</p>
<p class="p2">Verso rower and alumna, Dr. Katie Wadden (B.Kin.’08, M.Sc. (Kin.’10), is a sessional instructor in Memorial’s School of Human Kinetics and Recreation, teaching exercise psychology.</p>
<p class="p2">The topic of her course explores the importance of modelling to motivate individuals to adopt and adhere to exercise.</p>
<p class="p2">“We know that when individuals see others who are like them participating and performing in sport, it dramatically influences their self-perception,” said Dr. Wadden. “This was not lost on me on Regatta Day. Girls and women need to see other girls and women performing feats that they were once told they couldn’t because of their gender. This is how progress in sports and culture works.”</p>
<p class="p4">She also says that in the field of exercise science, only six per cent of studies were conducted exclusively on women from 2014–20. Those kinds of statistics motivate her research at Memorial.</p>        </div>

But it was during an internship at the European Space Agency when her passion really took off. Following that experience, she completed a master&#8217;s degree in aerospace engineering at the University of Toronto’s Institute of Aerospace Studies, which led her to work with balloon telescopes—a type of airborne telescope.</p>        </div>

<p class="p2">“This will be SuperBIT’s &#8216;science&#8217; flight, and it will hopefully spend weeks in the stratosphere at an altitude of approximately 35 kilometres,” she said. “SuperBIT is an optical-to-near-ultraviolet telescope that studies dark matter via galaxy cluster weak lensing.” </p>
<p class="p2">Prior to working in New Zealand, she was in Antarctica at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station">McMurdo Station</a> working on a balloon-borne telescope called the SPIDER-II.</p>
<p class="p2">“SPIDER-II is a microwave polarimeter that studies the afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background) using six telescopes housed in a vacuum vessel filled with liquid helium to cool the detectors to 300 milli-Kelvin (approximately -272.8 degrees C),” Ms. Redmond explained. “The instrument was lifted by a balloon the size of a rugby stadium to an altitude of 35 kilometres for approximately two weeks.”</p>
<p class="p2">When the experiments conclude, the payload separates from the balloon and parachutes back down to Earth. The hard drives, which hold the data, are recovered, as well as the payload carcass. For the New Zealand and Antarctica flights, teams conducted a pre-deployment integration campaign in Palestine, Texas.</p>

The recovery for the payload in Antarctica was more difficult and required a team to be flown out to the landing site to retrieve the instrument. The entire structure must be retrieved, if it is safe to do so, to minimize pollution of the environment. This means a lot of the structure must be chopped up to fit into the small plane that is used for recovery. </blockquote><span class="quote-credit">&#8211; Susan Redmond</span></p>

        <p>Ms. Redmond is currently completing a doctor of philosophy degree at Princeton University. She plans to start a post-doctoral position in the fall, focusing on high-contrast imaging work. With the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Roman Space Telescope</a> and the development of the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/habex/#:~:text=The%20Habitable%20Exoplanet%20Observatory%20(HabEx,and%20characterize%20their%20atmospheric%20content">Habitable World’s Observatory</a>, there are exciting projects in her future.</p>
<p>Working as part of a team is not new to Ms. Redmond. When she was a student at Memorial, she says there was a saying that “engineering is a team sport.”</p>
<p>“I think this was one of my favourite things about the program. Everyone was working to try and make sure everyone succeeded. Whether it was an exam or an interview, there was always a very collaborative and friendly approach among my classmates, as well as the class above us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her advice to current students? Be creative and look far and wide for work-term opportunities.</p>        </div>

        <p class="p2"><strong>DR. MAXIME GEOFFROY</strong>, a research scientist at the Marine Institute, is participating in the Arctic research project of a lifetime.</p>
<p class="p2">He is part of an international committee planning a 20-year study of the central Arctic Ocean and the impact of climate change in the region. It’s scheduled to begin in 2025 using a purpose-built, floating platform called the <a href="https://fondationtaraocean.org/en/schooner/tara-polar-station/">Tara Polar Station</a>. The station will drift across the ocean with the sea ice while researchers make observations, gather data and conduct experiments.</p>
<p class="p2">“Having a platform where researchers will be taking measurements year after year for two decades will provide unique datasets that will help us understand the seasonality of the central Arctic Ocean’s marine ecology and the long-term changes happening there,” said Dr. Geoffroy.</p>
<p class="p2">“The committee will determine the types of research projects to be done, how to gather the data and what kind of measurements will be taken.”</p>
<p class="p2">Construction of the Tara Polar Station began last year and was funded by France and the European Union. It is designed to withstand ice pressures and accommodate up to 20 people in summer and 12 during the polar winter, along with two dogs serving as polar bear guards and therapy pets.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Changing ecosystem</h2>
<p class="p2">The station is expected to drift in ice across the central Arctic Ocean for up to 18 months at a time during 10 consecutive expeditions. However, Dr. Geoffroy says the duration of the trips may decrease over time due to climate change.</p>
<p class="p2">“In 2045 it’s probably going to take less time,” he said. “It could be as little as one year because the ice is shrinking so quickly in the summer. We know this is one the fastest changing ecosystems in the world — it warms up to four times faster than the rest of the planet.”</p>
<p class="p4">The central Arctic Ocean spans 2.8-million-square kilometres.</p>

<p class="p3">Dr. Geoffroy has conducted research in the Arctic since 2008. He specializes in Arctic and subarctic fish ecology and the use of acoustics and new technology to study marine ecosystems. Fisheries acoustics use sound waves to estimate the number of fish, as well as their distribution, shape and size.</p>
<p class="p2">He works with the <a href="https://www.mi.mun.ca/departments/centreforfisheriesecosystemsresearch/">Marine Institute’s Centre for Fisheries Ecosystems Research</a>, where he supervises 12 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.</p>
<p class="p3">Dr. Geoffroy was invited to participate in the Tara Polar Station through collaborations with researchers from Laval University in Quebec and the University of Tromsø in Norway, who are also participating in the project. The multidisciplinary science committee includes members from nine countries.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Twilight zone</h2>
<p class="p3">Increasingly, Dr. Geoffroy’s research focuses on mesopelagic fish, which play an important role in the ocean&#8217;s carbon cycle.</p>        </div>

        <p class="p2">The fish migrate at night to the ocean surface to feed on zooplankton and return to the depths during daylight. As they return to deeper water, their respiration and waste transports carbon from the surface to the deeper ocean — also known as carbon export.</p>
<p class="p2">“They help regulate the climate, and we know it’s a big part of the carbon cycle in the ocean,” Dr. Geoffroy continued. “We don’t know how exactly it’s happening in the Arctic, where you have a seasonal light cycle rather than a daily light cycle as in other oceans. It’s one of the questions we’ll be able to tackle with the Tara Polar Station.”</p>
<h2 class="p3">Southern fish migration</h2>
<p class="p2">Another question focuses on the movement of southern fish into Arctic waters. Dr. Geoffroy says fish — such as cod, redfish and mackerel — have been found in the North, leading to predictions that North Atlantic fish will migrate further north due to climate change.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s not clear if they’re able to survive a dark, cold winter in the Arctic. So that’s a question we’re trying to answer: the rate of change in the fish community year-round.”</p>
<h2 class="p3">DNA analysis</h2>
<p class="p2">The station’s laboratories will be equipped with DNA sequencing tools that enable researchers to analyze environmental DNA in seawater samples to identify marine species.</p>
<p class="p2">“The Tara Ocean group of scientists have used this genetic analysis in the past. It’s been done mainly for micro-organisms and phytoplankton, and now we’re expanding this technique to fish and larger animals,” said Dr. Geoffroy.</p>
<p class="p4">Construction of the polar station is led by Tara Ocean Foundation, a French non-profit organization dedicated to ocean science, exploration and education.</p>        </div>

<p class="p2">Few people realize the role Memorial University’s Newfoundland Folklore and Language Archive (<a href="https://www.mun.ca/munfla/">MUNFLA</a>) has had in preserving the province’s heritage. It is a place populated with friendly ghosts, containing more than 50,000 recordings and photographs of beloved family members from generations ago. It’s one of the only places Newfoundlanders and Labradorians can go to hear their ancestors’ voices.</p>
<p class="p2">A joint venture between the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences’ departments of English and Folklore, MUNFLA was established in 1968 by Dr. Herbert Halpert and Violetta Halpert, who passed away in 2000 and 2009, respectively. The vision was to co-ordinate diverse research in Newfoundland and Labrador studies, facilitate the use of common material organized for research and publication and to create a permanent record for future generations of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. It has spawned such groundbreaking publications as Dr. Halpert’s and Dr. John Widdowson’s <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Folktales-of-Newfoundland-Pbdirect-The-Resilience-of-the-Oral-Tradition/Widdowson-Halpert/p/book/9781138845480"><i>Folktales of Newfoundland</i></a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Dr. Widdowson, who was appointed as a professor of English language and literature at Memorial in 1962, greeted the Halperts upon their arrival to Newfoundland from Kentucky that same year.</p>        </div>

        <p class="p2">To remedy the situation, Dr. Halpert suggested Iona and Peter Opie’s <i>The Lore and Language of School Children </i>(1959), and asked Dr. Widdowson to write down any examples of folktales he knew. It was then that he began to understand what folklore is.</p>
<p class="p2">“Eventually, I had about 500 examples of folktales I already knew, so it was like a Damascus moment when I added my interest in folklore to my interest in language,” Dr. Widdowson said. “He was my mentor, the supervisor of my doctoral thesis and the most generous sharer of information.”</p>
<p class="p2">Today, the archive contains a vast collection of Newfoundland and Labrador folksongs, folk narratives of many kinds, oral histories, folk customs, beliefs and practices, childlore and descriptions of material culture. Over the decades, thousands of Memorial students contributed to its population. Students not only work at the archive as assistants doing jobs such as cataloguing and digitizing, but their donations of course-related work is the bedrock upon which MUNFLA was built.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>The student journey </b></h2>
<p class="p2">Dr. Martin Lovelace, a former head of the Department of Folkore, first arrived at Memorial as a student in 1972. He completed his master’s and doctoral theses under Dr. Halpert’s supervision.</p>
<p class="p2">“I don’t think I’ve met anybody else in university life who were as committed to their discipline as Herbert and Letty,” said Dr. Lovelace. “She was an absolute scholar in her own right and knew everything that Herbert did, maybe more. When you went to their home, you could see her massive collection of works on domestic crafts and arts, quilts, textiles. Letty did foundational work in the archive in the early stages. By the time I arrived, the archive was established and beginning to fill with materials.”</p>
<p class="p2">He emphasizes the value of student contributions to the archive, as well. “So many students in those years, particularly those coming from rural areas of the province, were the first generation of their families to go to university. I think they must have found it extremely empowering and encouraging to realize that already they knew things that were valuable. They knew this culture. They might have feared they didn’t know as much about &#8216;high culture&#8217; as they should — though whether the townies knew any more than they did was an open question,” he said with a laugh.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>The Halpert Estate Bequest </b></h2>
<p class="p2">The Halperts donated their personal folklore library, containing approximately 13,000 volumes and considered one of the finest private collections in the world, to the Queen Elizabeth II Library. MUNFLA retained the contents of Dr. Halpert’s office, now known as the <a href="https://www.library.mun.ca/asc/specialcollections/collections/halpert/">Herbert Halpert Research Collection</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">Additionally, the Halperts established a generous bequest from the estate of Violetta Halpert, which includes a Travel Research Award to fund costs related to national and international travel for the presentation of folklore research using the Herbert Halpert Research Collection and/or any other collection housed in MUNFLA. They also left a significant donation to MUNFLA.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;After decades of underfunding and understaffing, it feels like the archive has been gifted new life,” said Dr. Holly Everett, head of the Department of Folklore.</p>
<p class="p2">Archivist Pauline Cox says she was “rendered speechless” and shed tears upon hearing the news.</p>
<p class="p2">“You cannot look at any of our earliest collections or indexes and not see the impact Herbert and Letty had,” she said. “In later years, their son, Nick, also made contributions to the archive. Without the Halpert family, MUNFLA simply would not be. With this most generous bequest from the estate, they have ensured our future, and all that it exists to collect and preserve for generations to come. Our future is much brighter thanks to their generosity. We will do all that we can to ensure we carry on their legacy in a manner that would make them happy and proud.”</p>

        <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">ONE OF THE REASONS </span></strong>I like the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is its stunning ruggedness. Its vast shorelines juxtapose crashing waves with cold, clear, salty waters that are full of life. Vertical cliffs contrast with snow and frozen highlands. Sea stacks are evidence of the changing landscape of this great place. Fog abounds.</p>
<p class="p2">As ever-changing as our province’s geography, our university’s change-makers are equally as varied.</p>
<p class="p2">Memorial University College was founded by change-makers—by people who believed that education was the path forward. They set the province on a new trajectory, one that offered a post-secondary education that would build our future. They changed the lives of everyone who calls Newfoundland and Labrador home.</p>
<p class="p2">Dr. Helena Frecker (née McGrath) set the stage for change-makers at Memorial University when she became the first person to graduate.</p>
<p class="p2">In this issue, you’ll read all about a few of the change-makers who emerged into the world from Memorial since Helena crossed the stage.</p>
<p class="p2">Our cover story highlights the past, present and future influencers of oceans research and discovery. From geography to marine life and from engineering to technology, you’ll read about researchers such as Dr. Paul Snelgrove (B.Sc.(Hons.)’84) and his colleagues and their impacts on our understanding of the world beneath the water.</p>
<p class="p2">You’ll discover change-makers from our past and learn about emerging visionaries who are already improving the world around us.</p>
<p class="p2">Anyone has the power within them to become a change-maker. As Barack Obama famously said, “We are the change that we seek.”</p>
<p class="p3">As you learn about our trailblazers of the past and present, you might think of someone in your life who is a change-maker of tomorrow.</p>

        <p class="p2"><strong>ON MAY 15</strong>, Memorial University&#8217;s Marine Institute officially opened <a href="https://www.thelaunch.mi.mun.ca/">The Launch</a>: a hub for cold-ocean innovation, discovery, learning and leadership for the global oceans sector.</p>
<p class="p2">Formerly known as the Holyrood Marine Base, The Launch will support at-sea education, training and research in the areas of ocean science and technology, ocean safety, fisheries and the marine environment.</p>
<p class="p2">Strategically located in Holyrood, N.L., the facility sits on the cold, clean waters of the Labrador Current, offering access to deep-water, cold-ocean research and development almost year-round.</p>
<p class="p2">Director Kelley Santos is excited for the training and research opportunities and collaborations The Launch will bring.</p>
<p class="p3">“Expansion of this facility, combined with the tremendous opportunities currently available for the ocean technology sector, will provide a vibrant, innovative centre for advancing technology development, training and research for Memorial University and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador,” said Ms. Santos.</p>
<p class="p2">The Launch includes the following features:</p>
<p class="p2">• The Dr. Arthur W. May building — a newly completed 3,345-square-metre, multi-purpose building with large, high bay workshops with wharf access</p>
<p class="p2">• A 557-square-metre building for ocean observation and safety and survival training</p>
<p class="p2">• Industry and academic spaces with laboratories, classrooms, conference, office and collaboration spaces</p>
<p class="p2">• Sheltered access to the Atlantic Ocean via marginal wharf and finger pier</p>
<p class="p2">• A marine fleet with a variety of work vessels equipped with highly specialized technology, and autonomous and remotely operated vehicles available for academic and research and development purposes</p>
<p class="p3">• A Subsea Centre of Excellence — a water lot featuring infrastructure to support the evaluation and development of next-generation ocean technologies, autonomous systems, remote operations, digitalization and ocean vehicle training and research. With access to technology, technical expertise, vessels and collaborative partnerships, The Launch will be a premier oceans innovation centre to further Canada’s Blue Economy Strategy and support opportunities presented by the United Nations’ Decade of Ocean Science.</p>        </div>
